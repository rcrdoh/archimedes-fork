# MVP Scope Memo

> **Date:** 2026-05-12 (Day 2)
> **Audience:** Archimedes hackathon team
> **Purpose:** Formalize three scope decisions that came out of the Day-2 standup and the
> design-doc review: RFB lock-in, on-chain ambition, and strategy-library breadth. This is
> the document the team commits to — when scope creep starts, this is the back-pressure
> reference.

## TL;DR

1. **Primary RFB: 04 — Adaptive Portfolio Manager.** Adjacent: RFB 02 (Kelly/+EV math
   primitive); RFB 06 (strategy leaderboard).
2. **Both on-chain stories are in scope:** ArchimedesVault contracts for RWA-token
   allocation **and** ReasoningTraceRegistry for verifiable provenance. Shoot for the moon.
3. **Strategy library v1 = curated, ~5–10 hand-built strategies.** Arxiv ingest pipeline
   runs as a demo feature on 2–3 papers — shown in the pitch, not relied on for the wow
   moment.

These three decisions cascade through every other doc in `docs/`. Treat them as locked
unless the team explicitly agrees to change one (and updates this memo).

## Decision 1 — RFB lock-in

### Choice

- **Primary RFB:** 04 — Adaptive Portfolio Manager
- **Math primitive cited:** RFB 02 — Prediction Market Trader Intelligence (Kelly Criterion
  / +EV / position sizing). Önder's work on the portfolio-math module is structurally the
  RFB 02 mechanic applied inside RFB 04's portfolio construction.
- **Adjacent showcase:** RFB 06 — Social Trading Intelligence. The strategy-performance
  leaderboard in the frontend (per Chuan's [`design.md` § 4.2](design.md)) is RFB 06
  flavored — users follow top-performing strategies via paper-grounded reasoning traces.

### Why not the others

- **RFB 01 — Perp futures trading.** High regulatory risk; demo-fragile (liquidation
  events look catastrophic on stage); requires real-time risk infrastructure we can't
  ship cleanly in 12 days. Chuan's RWA/spot framing avoids the leverage failure modes
  entirely.
- **RFB 03 — Prediction market verticals.** Different product shape (creating new markets,
  not managing portfolios). Adjacent to where we'd go in v2, not where v1 lives.
- **RFB 05 — Cross-platform arbitrage.** Latency-sensitive; demo would be either a
  recorded video of arbitrage or a stale screenshot. Doesn't showcase paper-grounded
  reasoning.

### Detail

See [`rfb-alignment.md`](rfb-alignment.md) for the full per-RFB analysis with judging-
criteria mapping.

## Decision 2 — Both on-chain stories are in scope

### Choice

Build both Arc-native components:

1. **ArchimedesVault contracts** (per Chuan's [`design.md` § 5.2](design.md)) — user
   deposits USDC, agent has rebalance authority, RWA tokens flow through CCTP/Gateway
   between Arc and source chains.
2. **ReasoningTraceRegistry contract** — every agent decision is hashed and anchored on
   Arc; the off-chain trace can be verified against the on-chain hash by anyone.

### Why both

The team is now 5 committed people with deep skill coverage:

- **Chuan** has built production crypto-trading infrastructure (CoinShares); the smart
  contracts are within his routine engineering effort, not a stretch.
- **Marten** is paired with Chuan on off-chain ↔ on-chain integration via Arc CLI.
- **Daniel** has full backend chops to handle the off-chain side around the contracts.
- **Önder** can do the math (Kelly sizing, regime-detection thresholds, rebalance triggers)
  that drives what the contracts execute.
- **Dan** is on strategy curation (the input layer) and pitch (the output layer), with the
  capacity to spike into any component.

Two team members run Claude at high tier (Chuan 20×, Dan 5×), which significantly multiplies
implementation throughput. Shooting for both on-chain stories is the call that distinguishes
this team from a single-component hackathon project.

### Why this is achievable

The architecture is clean:

- The two contracts are **independent** — the vault doesn't need to know about the trace
  registry, and vice versa. Either can ship without the other; failure modes are isolated.
- The contracts are **small** — Chuan's [`design.md` § 5.2](design.md) sketches both at
  under 10 functions total. Each is a 1–2 day Solidity build with thorough testing.
- The off-chain integration is **scoped per Circle tool** — Wallets and Paymaster are
  routine; CCTP/Gateway are the harder integrations but well-documented.

### What we'd cut if we run out of time

If by end of Week 1 only one of the two contracts is solidly working, **prioritize the
vault** (because that's what enables the live demo's "judges deposit and watch portfolio
construction happen" moment). The trace registry is a v1.5 ship if necessary; the off-
chain trace data is still valuable and the on-chain anchor is an additive verifiability
property.

But the plan is: ship both.

## Decision 3 — Curated v1 strategy library, arxiv pipeline as demo

### Choice

- **Library:** 5–10 strategies, hand-curated by Dan, each tied to a real published quant
  paper with arxiv ID, backtest validated against historical data.
- **Arxiv pipeline:** Built and demonstrated end-to-end on 2–3 papers during the pitch,
  showing the path from paper to strategy. **Not relied on** for the live demo's portfolio
  construction.

### Why curated v1

- **Trust at demo time matters more than scale at demo time.** A judge who sees a strategy
  that quotes "Jegadeesh & Titman 1993, ten paragraphs of methodology summary, 4.2 Sharpe
  in our backtest, paper claimed 4.6 Sharpe" trusts the platform. A judge who sees an
  LLM-extracted strategy from a random arxiv paper that hasn't been vetted is wondering if
  the strategy hallucinated.
- **Curation lets Dan apply scientific judgment.** Dan's background is biochemistry and
  bioinformatics — he is structurally well-equipped to evaluate published research for
  methodology rigor. The seed corpus benefits from his read.
- **Curation closes the "what if the LLM-extracted strategy is wrong" risk** Chuan flagged
  in [`design.md` § 10](design.md) — human validation gate.

### Where the arxiv pipeline goes

It still gets built. We demo it. We just don't bet the live portfolio on it.

In the pitch:

- Live demo uses the curated library (10 strategies, all paper-grounded, all backtested).
- A separate "arxiv ingest" segment shows the pipeline running on a fresh paper, extracting
  a strategy, validating it, adding it as a "candidate" to the library awaiting human
  vetting. **The pipeline is a v2 story** — the v1 demo is a portfolio agent grounded in
  curated research.

### Curation criteria

See [`qfin-paper-corpus-seed.md`](qfin-paper-corpus-seed.md) for the categorized seed list
and the per-paper rationale. Headline criteria for a paper to make the v1 library:

1. **Published in a peer-reviewed journal or arxiv with significant citations.**
2. **Strategy is implementable** (well-defined entry/exit signals, available data, no
   proprietary feeds).
3. **Backtest period ≥ 10 years** so we can validate in-sample / out-of-sample on liquid
   markets.
4. **Sharpe ≥ 0.5 in our re-run** at conservative transaction costs (10bps round-trip).
5. **No look-ahead bias** in our re-run (walk-forward only).

## Cross-decision implications

- These three choices imply **a sharper demo wow-moment** than the agent-marketplace v1 we
  had earlier. The user-facing flow is: "connect wallet → pick risk profile → see a
  portfolio of paper-grounded strategies → deposit USDC → watch the agent build the
  portfolio on Arc → audit the reasoning trace." That's a coherent 60-second narrative.
- They also imply **the team owns its own corpus.** The Q-fin paper corpus becomes an
  Archimedes asset that compounds — better curation = better strategy library = better
  portfolios = better moat.
- They imply **anti-features** we should be explicit about — see
  [`anti-features.md`](anti-features.md). No native token, no perp leverage, no third-party
  strategy onboarding in v1, no fiat on-ramp, no mobile app.

## What changes if the team disagrees

This memo is the negotiation surface. If by Day 4 there's strong evidence one of these
decisions is wrong (e.g., the vault contract is taking longer than expected and we need to
drop trace-registry scope), we update this memo with the new decision and the date. **Don't
let scope silently drift** — make the change visible.

## Open decisions explicitly deferred

These aren't covered by this memo and should be decided by Day 4 or Day 5:

- **Backtesting library:** backtrader vs. vectorbt vs. custom numpy. See
  [`specs/backtrader-vs-vectorbt-decision-memo.md`](specs/backtrader-vs-vectorbt-decision-memo.md).
- **Backend ownership:** vacant since Shimon's departure. Decide by Day 3.
- **EURC inclusion:** USDC-only for v1, or USDC + EURC for international users? Decide
  based on regulatory and integration cost; default to USDC-only.
- **Public beta vs invite-only beta** for the traction push in Week 2.
