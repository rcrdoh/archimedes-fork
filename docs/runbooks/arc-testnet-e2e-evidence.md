## Identity

- **Wallet (user):** `0x8b5EEE65c78aB9e39825A4a7991b13686442fc14`
- **Funded via:** Circle faucet (`https://faucet.circle.com/`) — testnet USDC at `0x3600000000000000000000000000000000000000`

## Vaults deployed

Both Tier-1 rigor-passing strategies were deployed as **separate
non-custodial vaults**, each owned by the operator's wallet. This is the
architectural proof point from PR #342 Part 2: `vault.creator == user`,
not `vault.creator == backend`.

## Phase 5 — Deploy transactions (Arc testnet)

The deploy flow per [`spec-1-walkthrough.md`](./spec-1-walkthrough.md):

| Step | Action | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `VaultFactory.createVault()` | Creates ERC-4626 vault, user = creator |
| 2 | `vault.setAgent(operatorAddr)` | Grants the agent rebalance authority (NOT withdraw) |
| 3 | `USDC.approve(vault, depositAmount)` | Bounded spending cap — never unlimited |
| 4 | `vault.deposit() + setTargetAllocations()` | Pulls USDC + locks strategy targets |

All four confirmed on-chain. Receipt for step 4 verified live:

- Block: `44031374`
- Status: **SUCCESS** ✅
- Gas used: `190,890`

- Logs emitted: 4 (deposit + share mint + approval delta + target allocation set)

### Summary

**8 transactions total**, nonces 0–7, all `txreceipt_status: 1`. Two complete
4-signature deploy sequences in ~25 minutes of wall-clock time. Every hash
above resolves to a public, replayable receipt on Arc testnet.

## Phase 6 — Portfolio dashboard verification (the architectural fix)

Per PR #342 Part 2, the user-as-creator architecture was the load-bearing
change. The pre-#342 backend-as-creator architecture returned `[]` from
`getVaultsByCreator(walletAddr)`, so user-deployed vaults never showed
up on the Portfolio page. After #342 Part 2, the Portfolio page lists
the operator's own vaults correctly.

**Live evidence (screenshot of `https://archimedes-arc.com/portfolio` at
~03:10 TR time, 2026-05-26):**

| Tile | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Wallet USDC** | `$7.88` (idle — initial 9.94 minus deposits + gas) |
| **Vault AUM** | `$12.00 across 2 vaults` |
| **Unrealized PnL** | `$0.00 / +0.00%` |
| **Agent** | **Alive** (heartbeat 1m ago) |
| **Regime** | `RISK ON 92.0% confidence` |

Both vaults appear in the **Your vault positions** section with correct
addresses, AUM, and tier (Community). The architectural proof point —
*"the user controls the vault, the backend doesn't"* — is confirmed.

## Phase 7 — Reasoning trace (captured 2026-05-27)

The agent is **alive and autonomously producing reasoning traces**, each
hashed and anchored on-chain. A representative trace captured from the live
`/api/traces` feed:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Trace ID | `92235ad9-1fd1-40e0-9c91-227dbd191f5e` |
| Decision | `skip` |
| Trigger | `insufficient_liquidity` |
| Reasoning | `Swap skipped — thin pool: No AMM pool for USDC: getPool returned zero address` |
| Regime at decision | `risk_on` |
| Confidence | `0.5865` |
| Trace hash | `0434b6b58c93d80fa83111836458627e42ae063987e3ec602827a49cc6477563` |
| Anchor tx (`arc_tx_hash`) | [`0x3813949065...d3b9f73bf`](https://testnet.arcscan.app/tx/0x3813949065cf8eb587be478fe1cdcd2126aac90ea6cc0037b64b395d3b9f73bf) |
| Commit tx (commit-reveal) | [`0x5a3f7c7713...6c636393c`](https://testnet.arcscan.app/tx/0x5a3f7c771384cd9b9c889982ff910554ec0b4dcd53328ab2912e46c6d636393c) |
| Verified on-chain | `true` |

This single trace demonstrates the full autonomous loop **without faking a
trade**: the agent classified the regime (`risk_on`), evaluated a rebalance,
hit the pre-trade liquidity guard, **decided to skip**, hashed the decision,
and **anchored the hash on Arc** — verifiable by anyone.

### Honest limitations at capture time

1. **The agent's per-vault scope did not include the two operator vaults
   above.** All live traces at capture were for a bootstrapped demo vault
   (`0x827a2584…`). The operator's user-created vaults (`0x09eb…`, `0x84B0…`)
   were funded but not yet on the agent's tick list — related to the
   per-vault scoping work in issue #307. So the trace above is from a sibling
   vault, not the operator's own.
2. **The trace records a skip, not a trade**, because the AMM router returns
   `getPool returned zero address` for the USDC→synth path — even for the
   funded sTSLA pool. That is a router lookup bug, tracked separately (see the
   AMM `getPool` issue). Until it is fixed, *no* vault can actually rebalance;
   every trace is an honest `skip`.

Both limitations are surfaced rather than hidden. The "agent autonomously
rebalances on-chain" claim is currently proven only as far as "agent
autonomously *evaluates, decides, and anchors* on-chain"; the actual
on-chain swap is blocked by the router bug, not by the agent.

## Phase 8 — Verify on-chain

Each tx hash above resolves to a `Status: Success` row on
<https://testnet.arcscan.app> that judges or auditors can inspect without
trusting any screenshot in this file. The trace verification path
(post-PR #308 O(1) verify) lets a viewer click "Verify hash on-chain"
on any reasoning card and confirm the merkle root within ~1 second.

## What this proves

1. **The wedge is real.** Of 6 strategies in the library, exactly the 2
   that pass the four selection-bias gates (DSR ≥ 0.95, PBO < 0.5, OOS
   ratio ≥ 0.5, look-ahead AST audit clean) were deployable. The other 4
   — including the buy-and-hold baseline — were correctly gate-blocked.
2. **Non-custodial.** The user's wallet is the on-chain creator. The
   agent has rebalance authority only; no `withdrawTo(operator)` exists
   on the vault interface. Funds never pass through platform custody.
3. **End-to-end on real chain.** Every state change is anchored to an
   Arc testnet transaction with a public receipt. No mock backend, no
   sandboxed signer.
4. **Honest under constraints.** The pre-trade rigor guard (V-Check from
   PR #342 Part 3) skips trades into thin pools rather than reverting
   loudly or — worse — executing into shallow liquidity and getting
   sandwich-eaten. The "rigor" framing applies to runtime, not just
   admission.

## Replay instructions for judges

1. Open <https://archimedes-arc.com/>.
2. Connect MetaMask on Arc Testnet (chain ID `5042002`, RPC `https://rpc.testnet.arc.network`).
3. Fund the wallet via <https://faucet.circle.com/> (20 USDC every 2h).
4. Sidebar → **Library** → **Examples** tab → click any green-✅ rigor-passing entry.
5. **Deploy as Vault** → enter ≥ 2 USDC → sign 4 MetaMask popups.
6. Sidebar → **Portfolio** to see the new vault.
7. Wait 5 min, then **Reasoning** for the first trace; click **Verify hash on-chain**.
