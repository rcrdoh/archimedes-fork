## Why this note exists

The first three third-wave items built measurement machinery: a turnover-aware
cost model (gross-vs-net Sharpe, break-even cost), a faithful-scale Gatev
replication, and a walk-forward parameter selector. This note runs the library
through that machinery and answers two questions per CANDIDATE:

1. **Is the failure execution-cost-driven or alpha-absent?** The cost model
   separates the two: a strategy with a healthy *gross* Sharpe that dies net
   of costs is cost-bled (potentially rescuable by turnover control); one that
   is negative *before* costs has no alpha to rescue.
2. **Would honest parameter selection have rescued it?** The walk-forward
   harness picks each strategy's parameters on a trailing 4-year train window
   and evaluates on the next unseen year, rolling — the stitched OOS Sharpe is
   what a non-overfit deployment of that strategy family would actually have
   earned. Grids are small and paper-plausible (the values the papers
   themselves discuss), and `n_param_combos` is recorded per run.

Method notes: fresh runs on current yfinance data (2004→2026 window; the
joined window per strategy follows its instruments' inceptions), 10 bps/side.
Legacy fixture entries are known not to reproduce on current data (vintage
drift), so these are diagnostics, never written back to fixtures.
`capital_preservation_tbill` is skipped (it models a T-bill yield, not a
tradeable instrument run); `pipeline_buy_hold` is skipped as the trivial
baseline. The two gate-passers (Moreira-Muir, MOP TSMOM) and LIVE-status Faber
are included as reference rows.

## Part A — cost/turnover diagnosis (fresh runs, current data, 10 bps/side)

Reference rows first (the two gate-passers + LIVE Faber + the 52-week-high
legacy), then the CANDIDATEs. "Gross" adds back commissions only (not
slippage); "break-even" is the per-side cost at which the gross CAGR is fully
consumed — the implementability headroom.

¹ PCA's equity curve goes *negative* (minimum −$46k on $100k initial; 130%
drawdown) — gross-return reconstruction is mathematically undefined once
equity ≤ 0, and the engine reports `None` rather than a fabricated number.
That a "market-neutral" strategy can lose more than its capital at N=5 is
itself the finding (already documented on its passport).

### Part A findings

1. **The failures are alpha-absent, not cost-bled.** Every negative-net
   CANDIDATE is *also negative gross*. Even at zero cost, RSI-2 sits at −0.33,
   the pairs family at −0.28…−0.84, the portfolio-of-pairs at −1.37. The
   "Kalman hypothesis" — that execution costs were the binding constraint —
   is **rejected**: Kalman improves from −1.47 to −0.75 gross (costs *do*
   destroy 4.6%/yr at 22.9× turnover), but the costless version still fails
   decisively. No CANDIDATE's verdict would flip even with free execution.
2. **The gate implicitly selects for implementability.** The survivors and
   near-misses all have wide break-even headroom: risk parity 1221 bps, Brock
   dual-MA 808, Moreira-Muir 361, TSMOM 214, dual momentum 116. The failures
   sit at ≤ 50 bps — many at ~0 — meaning even institutional-grade execution
   could not make them investable. Break-even cost is the cleanest single
   screening number this re-test produced.
3. **Turnover sees what trade-count cannot.** Moreira-Muir reports **0
   closed trades** (it holds one continuously-resized position, which
   backtrader's TradeAnalyzer never counts as a round trip) yet turns over
   1.07× equity per year, paying a real 0.21%/yr. The fixture-level
   `total_trades` field materially understates activity for resize-style
   strategies; turnover is the honest activity metric.

## Part B — walk-forward parameter selection (train 1008 bars / test 252, OOS stitched)

| strategy | combos | folds | WF OOS Sharpe | default full-sample Sharpe | chosen params (mode) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| faber_2007_sma200_timing | 4 | 18 | +0.05 | +0.13 | sma_period=210 (8/18 folds) |
| donchian_breakout | 9 | 18 | +0.05 | −0.12 | entry=20, exit=50 (12/18 folds) |
| connors_alvarez_2009_rsi2 | 3 | 18 | −0.29 | −0.58 | rsi_entry=15 (16/18 folds) |
| bollinger_2001_band_reversion | 6 | 18 | −0.16 | −0.15 | period=20, dev=2.0 (8/18 folds) |
| brock_1992_dual_ma_crossover | 9 | 18 | +0.17 | +0.21 | fast=5, slow=200 (8/18 folds) |
| maillard_2010_risk_parity | 3 | 16 | +0.14 | +0.35 | lookback=42 (9/16 folds) |

### Part B findings

1. **Honest parameter selection rescues nothing.** No strategy's stitched
   OOS Sharpe comes anywhere near the gate. Donchian flips sign (−0.12 →
   +0.05) and RSI-2 halves its losses (−0.58 → −0.29), but "less bad" is not
   investable. The gate's verdicts are hereby confirmed by an independent
   method: these families fail not because we fixed the wrong parameter but
   because the underlying edge is not there on 2004–2026 data.
2. **Parameter instability is the overfitting signature.** The modal choice
   wins only ~half the folds for most strategies (Faber 8/18, Bollinger 8/18,
   Brock 8/18) — the "best" parameter is regime-dependent, which is exactly
   the condition under which in-sample selection overfits and PBO is the
   right alarm. RSI-2 is the exception (16/18 stable) and still loses.
3. **Risk parity's +0.35 is tempered, honestly.** Walk-forward over
   lookback ∈ {42, 63, 126} delivers +0.14 OOS vs +0.35 for the fixed
   default (63). Read precisely: the default was *not* mined (it is the
   3-month convention the literature uses), but the +0.35 does benefit from
   configuration luck that an adaptive selector would not have captured.
   This belongs in the [#537](https://github.com/a-apin/archimedes/issues/537)
   discussion as evidence on BOTH sides: `n_param_combos` here was 3 (not
   22), supporting the provenance-based `num_trials` split — while the
   +0.14 OOS suggests the recovered strategy should be sized conservatively.

## Conclusions

- **No CANDIDATE is promoted by this re-test, and that is the result.** The
  second-wave conclusion ("the gate is robust, not punitive") now has two
  independent confirmations: zero-cost re-runs don't flip any verdict, and
  honest OOS parameter selection doesn't either.
- **The cost model changes how we *read* strategies, not which ones pass:**
  break-even headroom cleanly separates the investable shelf (≥ 100 bps) from
  the uninvestable one (≤ 50 bps), and turnover exposes activity that
  trade-count misses.
- **What would actually move the needle** (carried forward on the roadmap):
  Kelly-sized allocation from the rigor metrics (Priority 3.1), library-level
  PBO from a daily-returns store (3.3), and the #537 `num_trials` decision —
  the one open item where a strategy's verdict legitimately depends on a
  policy choice rather than on the data.

## Non-goals honored

- No fixture entry was written or modified (`backtest_fixtures.json`
  untouched; verify with `git diff`).
- No gate logic, thresholds, or `num_trials` policy changed — #537 receives
  evidence, not a unilateral decision.
- No parameter from Part B was promoted into any strategy file's defaults;
  that would be in-sample selection wearing a costume.
