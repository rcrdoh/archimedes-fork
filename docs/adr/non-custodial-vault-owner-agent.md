# ADR: Non-custodial vault architecture — owner ≠ agent

> **Audience:** Archimedes team (decision owner: Dan; preferred contract reviewer: Bogdan `mnemonik-dev`)
> **Status:** **Accepted.** Implemented in [PR #731](https://github.com/a-apin/archimedes/pull/731) (owner≠agent vaults + `transferOwnership`); live on Arc testnet.
> **Question being decided:** Who holds withdrawal authority in user vaults? Can a compromised agent key drain user funds?
> **Related:** [`docs/specs/ecosystem-design-spec.md` § 3.2](../specs/ecosystem-design-spec.md), [`docs/architectural-principles.md`](../architectural-principles.md) (primitive #3), `contracts/src/Vault.sol`, `contracts/src/VaultFactory.sol`.

## TL;DR

**Separate the vault `owner` (the user, holds withdrawal authority) from the `agent` (Archimedes AI, holds rebalance authority only).** The agent can call `rebalance()` to move assets internally; it cannot withdraw, transfer, or redirect funds to a platform wallet. Only the owner can `withdraw()` / `redeem()`. This makes "non-custodial" a structural property of the contracts, not a claim backed by key hygiene alone — the same instinct as the Chainlink-primary oracle (remove the lone trusted writer in front of funds), applied to custody.

## Context

The Archimedes vault is an ERC-4626 tokenized vault holding user USDC + synth tokens. Rebalancing is continuous (drift thresholds, regime shifts, strategy rotation) — that is the agent's job. But rebalance authority sits one step from the funds: it moves USDC between assets and can mis-execute, yet must never be able to send user USDC to a platform address. An earlier shape conflated `creator` (deployer) with withdrawal authority, leaving a vector where a compromised agent key could rebalance *and* withdraw on the user's behalf. PR #731 makes the separation explicit and structural.

## Decision

**Distinct, bounded roles on the ERC-4626 vault:**
- **`owner`** (the user) — withdrawal authority only: `withdraw()` / `redeem()`. Cannot `rebalance()` or `setAgent()`.
- **`creator`** (deployer) — configuration authority: `setAgent()`, oracle/slippage config. Cannot `rebalance()`.
- **`agent`** (Archimedes AI, or a Tier-2 community manager) — `rebalance()` / `setTargetAllocations()` only. Cannot `withdraw()`, `redeem()`, `transfer()`, or `setAgent()`.

A rebalance cannot exfiltrate to a platform-held wallet: it operates only over the creator-curated asset allowlist, and only `withdraw()`/`redeem()` (owner-gated) route USDC to a receiver. `transferOwnership` lets the user retain/transfer their authority explicitly.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Non-custodial becomes a structural guarantee.** A compromised agent key can mis-rebalance (a *performance* risk) but cannot *steal* (a custody risk). The user's withdrawal signature is still required for any custodial action.
- **Clear Tier-1 / Tier-2 governance** — Tier-1 vaults are agent-deployed with the user as `owner`; Tier-2 community vaults use the same structure with a real-user creator.
- **Consistent with the oracle work** ([chainlink-primary-oracle](chainlink-primary-oracle.md)) — both remove a single trusted authority in front of funds. Together, "non-custodial" is a property, not a slogan.

### Negative / costs we accept
- **More roles + guards = more contract surface + test surface.** Mitigated by dedicated Foundry tests covering the role boundaries.
- **Operational care** — setting the agent to a wrong address blocks rebalancing until corrected (`setAgent()` is owner-only and deliberate). This is the correct fail-safe default.

## Alternatives considered
- **Single-role vault (creator == agent) — rejected** for security: it gives a compromised agent key full control over user funds — the exact vector PR #731 closes.
- **Time-lock / multi-sig on agent rotation — rejected as incomplete:** it slows key swaps but doesn't narrow the agent's authority *now*. The real defense is narrow authority, not slow rotation.

## Ratification

Accepted; implemented via PR #731 (live on Arc testnet). Commit-before-trade ([commit-reveal] enforcement, #589/#755) layers on top so a rebalance also requires a fresh, causally-prior reasoning-trace commitment.
