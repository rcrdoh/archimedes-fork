## TL;DR

Describe what you want; Archimedes fuses your intent with live market data and a 10,000-paper quantitative-finance research library into novel strategies, gates them through selection-bias rigor (Deflated Sharpe, Probability of Backtest Overfitting), and lets you execute them into non-custodial vaults on Arc testnet — every reasoning step traceable to a source paper and anchored on-chain.

### Run it locally in three commands

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:hackagora/archimedes-arcadia.git archimedes && cd archimedes
cp .env.example .env       # fill in ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN (GLM via Canteen, or BYO Anthropic key)
docker compose up -d --build
```

Then open <http://localhost>. Full walkthrough: [`SETUP.md`](SETUP.md).

> ⚠️ **`pytest` requires the docker stack to be running.** Before running the test suite,
> always spin up the services first: `docker compose up -d --build` (the `--build` flag
> rebuilds images after dependency changes). The tests depend on Postgres + Redis being
> reachable; without the stack you'll see connection errors, not test failures. Full
> testing notes in [`SETUP.md` § Running the test suite](SETUP.md#running-the-test-suite).

## Status (2026-05-22)

**Live on the Arc public testnet** (chain ID `5042002`): grab faucet USDC at <https://faucet.circle.com/> (20 USDC / 2h — on Arc, USDC *is* gas) and try the full flow with test funds. **No real money at risk, by design.** Arc has no mainnet yet (Circle's docs list mainnet as "upcoming"); mainnet launch, real-funds custody, and the regulatory architecture (off-chain redemptions, preset-strategy / RIA posture) are the **business-plan roadmap**, not hackathon scope — see [`docs/competitor-landscape.md`](docs/competitor-landscape.md).

**Built today:**

- Live testnet deploy: <http://13.40.112.220> · 10 Solidity contracts on Arc
- 3-input fusion engine: user brief × live market regime × 10,000-paper q-fin corpus → grounded strategy spec
- LLM-driven agentic portfolio advisor (`portfolio_agent.py`, 850 lines) — picks individual instruments and anchors each to a strategy passport
- Four-control selection-bias rigor gate (DSR + PBO + walk-forward OOS + look-ahead audit) — **2 Tier-1 strategies pass today** against 22 years of real SPY data
- Multi-asset NAV vaults — `Vault.totalAssets()` prices all synthetic holdings via oracles
- On-chain reasoning trace anchoring via the deployed `ReasoningTraceRegistry`
- 6-container docker stack: backend (FastAPI) + postgres + redis + nginx + oracle + agent
- 302 backend tests + 16 analytics-engine tests green

## Why Archimedes

| Category                  | Examples                                  | What's missing                                            |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| TradFi robo-advisors      | Wealthfront, Betterment                   | Rule-based, opaque, no on-chain settlement                |
| DeFi yield aggregators    | Yearn, Morpho-curated vaults              | Chase live yield, curation without proof of methodology   |
| AI-flavored crypto agents | Virtuals, SingularityDAO, Theoriq         | Token-mediated speculation; reasoning opaque              |

**Nobody is grounding portfolio decisions in peer-reviewed quant research with verifiable on-chain reasoning, settled in pure USDC.** That's the gap. Full thesis: [`docs/competitor-landscape.md`](docs/competitor-landscape.md).

## Development workflow

See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for full conventions. Headline points:

- **Branch model:** `main` is the single live branch — build-on-deploy (every merge triggers a CI deploy). Short-lived `<discord-handle>/<name>` branches → PR → `main`; rebase late, merge fast.
- **One approving review** for non-contract changes; two for contract changes.
- **Commit style:** imperative mood with optional scope tags (`[strategy]`, `[backend]`, `[contracts]`, `[docs]`, `[infra]`).
- **Lanes are descriptive, not prescriptive** — everyone is full-stack ([`CLAUDE.md` § Lead + coverage](CLAUDE.md)).

## Team

5 builders across 5 timezones with deep coverage on every load-bearing skill — see the team table in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).

## Contributing

Fork, branch (`<your-handle>/<short-name>`), PR to `main`. One logical change per PR. Never force-push `main`. Never commit secrets. See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for full conventions.
