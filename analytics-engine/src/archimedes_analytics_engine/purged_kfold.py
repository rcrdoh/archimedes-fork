"""Purged k-fold cross-validation for serial-correlated financial returns.

Standard k-fold CV leaks information through time when labels overlap with
features across the train/test boundary.  Marcos López de Prado's
*Advances in Financial Machine Learning* (Ch. 7) addresses this with two
mechanisms:

1. **Purging** — drop training observations whose labels span the test
   window.  Without this, a label generated from a 5-day forward return
   may be "in training" while its underlying price path is "in test".
2. **Embargoing** — after each test fold, embargo the next ``embargo_pct``
   of observations from training, to prevent leakage through serially-
   correlated features (e.g. rolling-window technical indicators built
   on the test window).

Standard scikit-learn ``KFold`` does neither.  Use this when your labels
are computed over a forward horizon (typical for momentum / mean-reversion
backtests) — i.e. virtually any non-trivial financial signal.

    Notes
    -----
    - Folds are **contiguous time windows** (not random), which is the
      only way to honor temporal causality.
    - Train sets may be discontinuous (a train fold at the start of
      time is *outside* the test window, then a train fold after the
      test window resumes after the embargo gap).
    - On very short embargo + dense labels, a fold may have zero usable
      training observations.  Caller should check ``len(train_idx) > 0``
      before fitting.
