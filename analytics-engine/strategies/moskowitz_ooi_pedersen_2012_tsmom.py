"""Time Series Momentum (TSMOM) — Moskowitz, Ooi, Pedersen 2012.

Single-asset adaptation: long if the trailing 12-month return is positive,
flat otherwise. The paper's diversified portfolio combines long *and* short
sleeves across equities, bonds, commodities, and currencies; v1 Archimedes
is spot/RWA only (no short selling — see `docs/anti-features.md`) so this
implementation collapses the short leg to flat. Document the divergence in
the methodology block so the paper-claimed-vs-actual delta is honest.

    "For a given asset, on each rebalance date compute the trailing 12-month "
    "total return r_{t-12,t}. The paper's diversified portfolio takes a long "
    "position when r > 0 and a short position when r < 0, scaling each "
    "position to a 40% ex-ante annualized volatility target using a 60-day "
    "exponential weighted standard deviation estimate. The portfolio is "
    "rebalanced monthly across 24 commodity futures, 12 cross-currency "
    "forwards, 9 equity index futures, and 13 government bond futures.\n\n"
    "v1 Archimedes adaptation (single-asset, long-only): on each daily bar "
    "after 252 trading days of history, evaluate the trailing 252-day "
    "return; if positive, target a long position sized to the full account "
    "value; if non-positive, close any open position. This loses the long-"
    "short structure that produces the paper's headline Sharpe of 1.43; "
    "single-asset TSMOM is documented to deliver per-asset Sharpes in the "
    "0.4-0.9 range. The backtest result is expected to underperform "
