"""Risk parity / inverse-volatility weighting (Maillard, Roncalli & Teïletche 2010).

Instead of equal-dollar weights (where the most volatile asset dominates the
portfolio's risk), weight each asset so it contributes comparable risk. This
implementation uses inverse-volatility weights — the diagonal special case of
the equal-risk-contribution (ERC) portfolio that Maillard et al. analyse, exact
when assets are equally correlated. Long-only, fully invested, rebalanced
monthly.

Requires ``engine.run_multi_backtest`` (it estimates each ``self.datas[i]``'s
volatility across the universe every rebalance).

METHODOLOGY_SUMMARY = (
    "Inverse-volatility risk parity. Each month weight every asset inversely to "
    "its recent volatility and normalize to fully invested, long-only — so a "
    "calm bond and a wild commodity contribute comparable risk rather than the "
    "volatile one dominating. The diagonal case of equal-risk-contribution."

METHODOLOGY_TEXT = (
    "Maillard, Roncalli & Teïletche (2010) formalize the equal-risk-contribution "
    "(ERC) portfolio, where every asset contributes the same share of total "
    "portfolio variance — a middle ground between minimum-variance and "
    "equal-weight that is far less concentrated than either. They show that when "
    "all pairwise correlations are equal, the ERC solution reduces exactly to "
    "INVERSE-VOLATILITY weights: w_i proportional to 1/sigma_i.\n\n"
    "v1 Archimedes adaptation (on the N-feed engine): we implement the "
    "inverse-volatility form rather than the full iterative ERC optimizer "
    "(which needs a numerical solver we deliberately don't add). Each rebalance "
    "(~21 bars) estimate each asset's daily-return volatility over a lookback "
    "(default 63 bars), set w_i ~ 1/sigma_i, normalize so the long-only weights "
    "sum to the deployed exposure, and order_target_percent to those weights. "
    "We disclose this as the inverse-vol approximation to ERC (exact under equal "
    "correlations) rather than claiming the full ERC portfolio.\n\n"
    "The paper is methodological (portfolio-construction properties), not a "
    "tradeable backtest with a headline Sharpe, so paper_claimed_* are null; the "
    "honest backtest fixture is authoritative."
