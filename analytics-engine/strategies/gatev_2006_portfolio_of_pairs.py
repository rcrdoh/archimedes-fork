"""Portfolio of pairs (faithful-scale distance method) — Gatev et al. 2006.

The faithful-scale replication of the Gatev, Goetzmann & Rouwenhorst design:
the paper's headline ~11% annualized excess return belongs to a *diversified
portfolio of the top ~20 pairs*, formed by minimum normalized-price distance
over a 12-month window and traded over the following 6 months — NOT to any
single pair. The library's four single-pair Gatev implementations are demo
scale; this strategy runs the actual formation → selection → trading cycle
over a 26-ETF universe via ``engine.run_multi_backtest``. Third-wave fidelity
item 2 (docs/specs/quant-roadmap.md Priority 2.1).

METHODOLOGY_SUMMARY = (
    "The paper's actual design at the paper's actual scale: every 6 months, "
    "rank all pairs in a 26-ETF universe by the distance between their "
    "normalized 12-month price paths, select the top 20, then trade each "
    "selected pair for the next 6 months — open dollar-neutral on a 2-sigma "
    "divergence of the spread, close when the normalized prices cross. "
    "Diversification across ~20 simultaneous pairs is what generated the "
    "paper's ~11% annualized excess return; single pairs are not comparable."
)

METHODOLOGY_TEXT = (
    "Gatev, Goetzmann & Rouwenhorst (2006) form pairs over a 12-month "
    "formation period by minimizing the sum of squared deviations (SSD) "
    "between normalized price series (cumulative return indices), then trade "
    "the top pairs over the subsequent 6-month period: open a dollar-neutral "
    "position (long the cheap leg, short the rich leg) when the spread "
    "diverges beyond two formation-period standard deviations; close when the "
    "normalized prices cross; force-close at the end of the trading period. "
    "Their ~11% annualized excess return is for diversified portfolios of the "
    "top 5-20 pairs on the CRSP cross-section 1962-2002.\n\n"
    "This Archimedes implementation is the FAITHFUL-SCALE replication on the "
    "N-feed engine — distinct from the library's four single-pair Gatev "
    "adaptations, which stream one fixed pair with a rolling z-score. Here "
    "the full cycle is mechanical and repeated: every 126 trading bars, "
    "normalize each asset's trailing 252-bar price path to 1.0 at the window "
    "start, compute SSD for every pair combination in the universe (26 ETFs "
    "-> 325 candidate pairs), select the 20 smallest-SSD pairs, and record "
    "each pair's formation-window spread standard deviation. During the "
    "trading window each pair opens when |spread| exceeds 2 sigma (short the "
    "high normalized leg, long the low), closes when the spread changes sign "
    "(the paths cross), and everything force-closes at the window end before "
    "re-formation. Capital follows the paper's committed-capital, "
    "self-financing accounting: each selected pair is committed exposure/20 "
    "of equity, and when triggered deploys that full share long AND short "
    "(the short proceeds finance the long leg), so each leg weighs "
    "exposure/20 and gross exposure reaches ~2x equity only if all 20 pairs "
    "are simultaneously open. Returns are on committed capital (idle pairs "
    "drag, as in the paper's committed basis; we do not re-lever onto open "
    "pairs, i.e. not the paper's higher-turnover fully-invested basis). "
    "Per-feed orders are netted across pairs sharing a leg. Market orders "
    "fill at the next bar's open, which matches the paper's more "
    "conservative one-day-waiting variant.\n\n"
    "Disclosed simplifications: (1) sequential non-overlapping 6-month "
    "trading periods rather than the paper's six staggered overlapping "
    "portfolios; (2) a liquid US-listed ETF universe (sectors, country funds, "
    "metals, staples substitutes, duration pairs) rather than the CRSP stock "
    "cross-section — fewer, more internally-diversified securities, so fewer "
    "true near-substitutes than the paper had; (3) no delisting/survivorship "
    "handling needed (ETFs alive throughout the joined window). Pure-python "
    "math, no new dependencies."
