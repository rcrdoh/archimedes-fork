"""Quality Minus Junk — Asness, Frazzini & Pedersen 2019 (price-based proxy).

The paper defines quality along four dimensions (profitability, safety,
growth, payout) using accounting fundamentals. Because the analytics engine
has no fundamental data we use the information ratio (mean_return / std_return)
over a trailing window as a price-based proxy for quality. The proxy captures
the two most tractable dimensions: a positive drift maps to 'profitable', and
low daily-return volatility maps to 'safe'. This is an approximation; see
METHODOLOGY_TEXT for the honest caveats and scope of the adaptation.

Requires ``engine.run_multi_backtest`` (reads every ``self.datas[i]`` each
rebalance). ``self.datas[0]`` is the market benchmark (assumed SPY) and is
included in the quality ranking.

METHODOLOGY_SUMMARY = (
    "Price-based proxy for the Quality Minus Junk factor. Rank assets by "
    "information ratio (mean / std of daily returns) over a trailing window. "
    "Long the high-quality (high IR) assets, short the low-quality (low IR) "
    "assets. A cross-sectional quality tilt without fundamental data."
)

METHODOLOGY_TEXT = (
    "Asness, Frazzini & Pedersen (2019) define quality along four dimensions "
    "computed from Compustat accounting data: (1) Profitability — ROA, ROE, "
    "gross margins, and accruals; (2) Safety — leverage, Altman Z-score, and "
    "idiosyncratic volatility; (3) Growth — five-year growth rates in the "
    "profitability measures; (4) Payout — equity and debt issuance, buyback "
    "yield. Each dimension is standardized and equally weighted into a single "
    "quality score. Going long high-quality and short low-quality ('junk') "
    "equities earned a Sharpe of approximately 1.0 on US stocks from 1956 to "
    "2012, largely independent of the market, value, and momentum factors.\n\n"
    "v1 Archimedes adaptation — price-based proxy: the analytics engine does "
    "not have balance-sheet or income-statement data, so we replace the four "
    "accounting dimensions with a single price-derived proxy: the information "
    "ratio (IR) = mean(daily_return) / std(daily_return) over the trailing "
    "'lookback' bars. The IR is tractable because it simultaneously captures "
    "the two most quantifiable quality dimensions — 'profitability' (positive "
    "drift, high mean return) and 'safety' (low variance). Growth and payout "
    "have no clean price-based analogue and are omitted. Each rebalance "
    "(every ~21 bars) assets are ranked by IR, the top long_frac are held "
    "long, and the bottom short_frac are held short, each in equal weight.\n\n"
    "Honest caveats: (1) This is a loose approximation of QMJ, not a faithful "
    "implementation. The paper's Sharpe ~1.0 is for a fundamental-data quality "
    "score on a broad US equity cross-section 1956-2012; it is provided as "
    "research context, not a benchmark for this adaptation — PAPER_CLAIMED_* "
    "are left null. (2) The IR proxy conflates the 'safety' and 'profitability' "
    "dimensions and captures nothing of 'growth' or 'payout'. (3) In a small "
    "cross-asset universe (SPY, NIKKEI, GOLD, TREASURY, OIL) the concept of "
    "cross-sectional quality is economically less clean than in a 500-stock "
    "universe. (4) Short positions in the analytics engine are executed at "
    "market via order_target_percent; realistic short-selling costs are not "
    "modelled."
