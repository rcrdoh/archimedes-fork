"""Dividend Yields and Expected Stock Returns — Fama & French 1988.

Fama & French (1988) show that the dividend yield (D/P) of stocks predicts
their subsequent returns: high-yield names earn higher expected returns,
especially over longer horizons, and the effect is most useful as a defensive,
income-like tilt. We have NO fundamental dividend data in the demo universe, so
this strategy uses a PRICE-BASED PROXY for the "steady income compounding"
characteristic that high-yield assets tend to exhibit — explicitly a loose
proxy, not a faithful dividend-yield sort.

Requires ``engine.run_multi_backtest`` (it reads every ``self.datas[i]`` each
bar to rank the universe). ``self.datas[0]`` is the market benchmark (SPY).

METHODOLOGY_SUMMARY = (
    "Dividend-yield tilt via a price-based proxy. Each rebalance, rank the "
    "universe by a 'yield proxy score' = mean daily return / max drawdown "
    "(income-like steadiness), go long the steadiest compounders and short "
    "the least steady, hold to the next rebalance. A loose proxy for the "
    "high-D/P sort Fama-French (1988) study — NOT a true dividend sort."
)

METHODOLOGY_TEXT = (
    "Fama & French (1988) regress future stock returns on the dividend yield "
    "(D/P) and find that dividend yield predicts subsequent returns: stocks "
    "with high D/P earn higher expected returns over the following months and "
    "years, with the explanatory power rising with the return horizon. High-"
    "yield names also behave defensively, providing an income-like compounding "
    "profile that holds up better in downturns.\n\n"
    "v1 Archimedes adaptation (cross-asset, on the N-feed engine): the demo "
    "universe has NO fundamental dividend data, so we CANNOT compute a real "
    "D/P. Instead we use a price-based PROXY for the 'steady income "
    "compounding' characteristic high-yield assets exhibit. For each asset we "
    "compute a yield proxy score = (mean daily return over the lookback) / "
    "(max drawdown over the lookback + epsilon). A higher score means steadier "
    "compounding with shallower drawdowns — the return signature of an income-"
    "like holding. Each rebalance (~21 bars) we rank the universe by this "
    "score, go long the top fraction and short the bottom fraction in equal "
    "weight (order_target_percent), holding to the next rebalance.\n\n"
    "Honest caveats: (1) this is a LOOSE PROXY and explicitly NOT a faithful "
    "dividend-yield sort — return-to-drawdown stability only correlates with "
    "the income-like profile of high-D/P assets; it does not measure dividend "
    "yield. (2) Fama-French (1988) study a broad single-market stock cross-"
    "section, not a 5-asset multi-market basket, so it is context, not a like-"
    "for-like benchmark — paper_claimed_* are left null."
