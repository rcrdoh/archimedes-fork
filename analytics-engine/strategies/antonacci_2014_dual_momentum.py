"""Dual momentum (Antonacci 2014, "Dual Momentum Investing").

Combine two momentum signals. RELATIVE momentum picks the strongest asset among
a set of risky assets. ABSOLUTE momentum (a.k.a. time-series momentum) is a
trend filter: only hold that winner if its own trailing return is positive;
otherwise retreat to a defensive asset (bonds / cash). The result is a
concentrated, one-asset-at-a-time rotation that sidesteps the worst of bear
markets.

Requires ``engine.run_multi_backtest`` (it inspects every risky ``self.datas[i]``
plus the defensive leg each rebalance). Antonacci's "Global Equities Momentum"
(GEM) is the canonical implementation.

METHODOLOGY_SUMMARY = (
    "Dual momentum: relative momentum picks the strongest risky asset; absolute "
    "momentum (a positive trailing return) decides whether to hold it at all or "
    "rotate to a defensive bond/cash asset. One asset held at a time, rebalanced "
    "monthly. Captures trend while stepping aside in downtrends."
)

METHODOLOGY_TEXT = (
    "Antonacci (2014) combines two momentum effects. RELATIVE momentum: among a "
    "set of risky assets, hold whichever has the highest trailing (e.g. 12-month) "
    "return. ABSOLUTE momentum: only hold that asset if its own trailing return "
    "beats the risk-free rate (otherwise the market is in a downtrend and you "
    "rotate to bonds/cash). His 'Global Equities Momentum' applies this to US vs "
    "international equities with a bond fallback, and he reports materially "
    "higher risk-adjusted returns and smaller drawdowns than buy-and-hold over "
    "1974-2013.\n\n"
    "v1 Archimedes adaptation (on the N-feed engine): the risky set is all "
    "universe assets EXCEPT the defensive leg; the defensive leg is TREASURY "
    "(TLT). Each rebalance (~21 bars) compute every asset's trailing return "
    "(close[0]/close[-lookback]-1, lookback 252). Relative step: pick the best "
    "risky asset. Absolute step: if its trailing return > the risk-free hurdle "
    "(~5%/yr) hold it 100%; else hold the defensive leg 100%.\n\n"
    "Honest caveats: Antonacci's headline figures are for his specific GEM asset "
    "set over his specific window, NOT this 5-asset basket — they are context, "
    "not a like-for-like benchmark, so paper_claimed_* are null. The source is a "
    "book/working paper, which typically reports no clean single-number Sharpe to "
    "lift anyway."
