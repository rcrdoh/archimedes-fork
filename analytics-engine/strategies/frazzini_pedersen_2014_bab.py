"""Betting Against Beta — Frazzini & Pedersen (2014).

Long leveraged low-beta assets, short deleveraged high-beta assets.
The low-beta anomaly contradicts CAPM: constrained investors' preference
for high-beta assets drives a flat or inverted Security Market Line, so
BAB earns alpha from the other side of that tilt.

Requires ``engine.run_multi_backtest`` (ranks assets cross-sectionally by
estimated rolling beta). ``self.datas[0]`` is treated as the market benchmark
(assumed SPY); the remaining feeds are the investable universe.

METHODOLOGY_SUMMARY = (
    "Estimate rolling OLS beta for each asset versus the market benchmark. "
    "Long the lowest-beta assets (leveraged to unit beta) and short the "
    "highest-beta assets (deleveraged to unit beta), earning the spread "
    "between the Security Market Line's slope and the actual flat/inverted SML."
)

METHODOLOGY_TEXT = (
    "Frazzini & Pedersen (2014) document that the Security Market Line is "
    "empirically flat or even inverted: high-beta assets earn lower "
    "risk-adjusted returns than CAPM predicts, and low-beta assets earn "
    "higher ones. The mechanism is leverage constraints: institutional "
    "investors who cannot lever up buy high-beta equities to increase "
    "expected returns, bidding up their prices and compressing their "
    "future returns. BAB exploits this by going long a portfolio of "
    "low-beta assets leveraged to unit beta and short a portfolio of "
    "high-beta assets deleveraged to unit beta.\n\n"
    "v1 Archimedes adaptation (cross-asset, N-feed engine): each rebalance "
    "(every ~21 bars) we estimate a rolling 63-day OLS beta for each asset "
    "vs datas[0] (the market benchmark, assumed SPY) using daily close "
    "returns. Assets are ranked by beta; the bottom long_frac are held long "
    "and the top short_frac are held short, in equal weight within each leg "
    "(order_target_percent). No explicit leverage rescaling to unit beta is "
    "applied — only the sign and equal weight within each leg — because the "
    "core insight (long low-beta, short high-beta) survives without it.\n\n"
    "Honest caveats: (1) The paper's results are for a broad US equity "
    "cross-section (thousands of stocks); our 5-asset basket is a conceptual "
    "demonstration of the signal, not a replication — paper_claimed_* are "
    "left null. (2) Beta is estimated from daily price-only data with no "
    "dividend or factor adjustment; measurement error in beta is higher for "
    "a small universe. (3) With only a handful of assets the long/short "
    "buckets may each contain only one or two names, so diversification is "
    "thin and idiosyncratic risk dominates."
