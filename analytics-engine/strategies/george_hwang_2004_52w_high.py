"""52-Week High Proximity Momentum — George & Hwang 2004.

Buy when the current price is within 10% of the trailing 52-week high; flat
otherwise. The mechanism: anchoring psychology and slow price discovery cause
stocks near their annual high to continue outperforming as the market gradually
incorporates positive news. Single-asset adaptation on SPY.

Paper divergence: the original is a cross-sectional strategy — rank all stocks
by (price / 52w_high), long top decile, short bottom decile. Here we adapt
it to a single-asset binary signal: invested when SPY itself is near its own
annual high, flat otherwise. The cross-sectional short leg and ranking are
removed; the directional alpha is lower than the paper claims.

METHODOLOGY_SUMMARY = (
    "Hold a long position when the current price is within 10% of the "
    "trailing 52-week high; otherwise hold cash. The signal captures the "
    "anchoring effect: investors underreact to good news when the stock is "
    "near its annual high, creating a continuation opportunity."

METHODOLOGY_TEXT = (
    "George & Hwang (2004) show that the ratio of current price to the "
    "trailing 52-week high is the dominant source of momentum profits. "
    "The cross-sectional strategy buys the top decile by this ratio and "
    "shorts the bottom decile, rebalanced monthly. The paper reports that "
    "the 52-week-high signal subsumes the standard 12-1 month momentum "
    "factor (Jegadeesh-Titman) in a horse race.\n\n"
    "v1 Archimedes adaptation (single-asset, long-only): on each daily bar "
    "after 252 trading days of history, compute high_ratio = "
    "close / max(close[-252:-1]). If high_ratio >= 0.90 (i.e., within 10% "
    "of the 52-week high), the account is fully invested; otherwise flat. "
    "This captures the signal direction without the short leg. The paper's "
    "long-short Sharpe of ~0.9 will not be reproduced; expected single-asset "
    "long-only performance is in the 0.4–0.7 range, consistent with other "
    "single-asset adaptations in this library."
