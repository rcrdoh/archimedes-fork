"""Cross-Asset Value Factor — Asness, Moskowitz & Pedersen (2013).

Long assets trading below their long-run price level (cheap); short assets
trading above it (expensive). Uses negative price deviation from a rolling
mean as a price-based cheapness proxy — the cross-asset value signal from
the "Value and Momentum Everywhere" Appendix Table AI.

Requires ``engine.run_multi_backtest``.

METHODOLOGY_SUMMARY = (
    "Cross-asset price-based value: rank assets by how far their current price "
    "lies below their rolling historical mean. Long the cheapest (most below mean), "
    "short the most expensive (most above mean). Monthly rebalance."
)

METHODOLOGY_TEXT = (
    "Asness, Moskowitz & Pedersen (2013) document robust value AND momentum premia "
    "across eight asset classes (global equities, equity indices, government bonds, "
    "currencies, and commodities). Their cross-asset value measure for individual "
    "stocks is book-to-price; for asset classes they use a 5-year return reversal "
    "(cheap = assets that have underperformed over the past 5 years). The paper "
    "reports a value factor Sharpe of ~0.6 averaged across asset classes.\n\n"
    "v1 Archimedes adaptation (price-based value on the N-feed engine): without "
    "fundamental ratios (P/B, E/P, dividend yield), we use the negative of the "
    "current price's deviation from its rolling mean over value_window bars as the "
    "cheapness proxy: value_score = -(close[0] / mean(close[-value_window:]) - 1). "
    "A large positive score means the asset is trading well below its historical "
    "mean, i.e., potentially cheap. This captures the mean-reversion dimension of "
    "cross-asset value described in the paper's Appendix Table AI proxies.\n\n"
    "Honest caveats: (1) This is a price-based proxy, not a fundamental valuation "
    "ratio. It measures cheapness relative to recent history, not relative to "
    "intrinsic value. (2) Our 5-asset universe is far narrower than the paper's "
    "8-class, 40+ market coverage — paper_claimed_* are null. (3) The mean-reversion "
    "signal can conflict with momentum; in practice value and momentum tend to be "
    "negatively correlated (as the paper documents), making them useful complements. "
    "(4) Rolling mean over a fixed window is sensitive to the choice of window — a "
    "known limitation of price-based value proxies."
