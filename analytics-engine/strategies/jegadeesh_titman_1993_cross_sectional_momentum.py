"""Cross-sectional momentum (Jegadeesh & Titman 1993).

The strategy wave 1 could NOT express, and the reason the engine grew an N-feed
runner. Each rebalance, rank the whole universe by trailing return, go long the
winners and short the losers in equal weight, and hold for a month. Returns come
from the cross-section (winners keep winning relative to losers), not from any
single asset's direction.

Requires ``engine.run_multi_backtest`` (it reads every ``self.datas[i]`` each
bar to rank the universe). Jegadeesh & Titman (1993) is the canonical academic
documentation of the momentum anomaly.

    "Jegadeesh & Titman (1993) document that US stocks sorted on their prior "
    "3-12 month returns exhibit momentum: past winners outperform past losers "
    "over the next 3-12 months. Their canonical design uses a J-month formation "
    "window, skips the most recent month (to avoid the short-term reversal "
    "effect), and holds a winners-minus-losers portfolio for K months. They "
    "report ~1% per month for the zero-cost winner-minus-loser portfolio on US "
    "equities 1965-1989.\n\n"
    "v1 Archimedes adaptation (cross-asset, on the N-feed engine): with a small "
    "asset universe rather than a stock cross-section, each rebalance (every "
    "~21 bars) we rank assets by their formation-window return "
    "(close[-skip]/close[-lookback] - 1; lookback 252, skip 21), then go long "
    "the top fraction and short the bottom fraction in equal weight "
    "(order_target_percent), holding to the next rebalance.\n\n"
    "Honest caveats: (1) the paper's ~1%/month is for a broad single-market "
    "stock cross-section, NOT a 5-asset multi-market basket, so it is context, "
    "not a like-for-like benchmark — paper_claimed_* are left null. (2) The demo "
    "universe mixes US ETFs, a Tokyo index, and futures whose daily closes are "
    "not simultaneous; cross-market momentum on non-synchronous closes is a "
    "known approximation, disclosed here rather than hidden."
