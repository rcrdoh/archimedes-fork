"""Capital Preservation via Short-Duration Treasury / USYC Allocation.

For investors who prioritise capital protection over returns. Holds the
SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (BIL) as the backtest proxy; in live
deployment on Arc the cash leg is held as USYC — Circle's on-chain
tokenised short-duration Treasury fund — which earns T-bill yield with
same-day on-chain settlement.

Designed for crypto newcomers who want yield without equity drawdown risk.
The strategy is the 'cash leg' of the Archimedes portfolio construction
framework: capital not deployed in a higher-conviction rigor-gated
strategy sits here.
