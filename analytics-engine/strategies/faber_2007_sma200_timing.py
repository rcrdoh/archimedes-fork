"""SMA200 Tactical Asset Allocation — Faber 2007.

Long the asset when its closing price is above the 200-day simple moving
average; in cash otherwise. The simplest published trend-filter that
materially reduces left-tail drawdowns versus buy-and-hold. Single-asset by
construction — drops cleanly into the analytics-engine per-instrument loop.

METHODOLOGY_TEXT = (
    "Faber's quantitative tactical-asset-allocation model evaluates each "
    "asset's monthly close against its 10-month simple moving average. If "
    "the close is above the SMA, the position is fully invested; if below, "
    "the position is moved to cash (T-bills in the paper). The model is "
    "applied across five asset classes (US equity, foreign equity, bonds, "
    "commodities, REITs) in an equal-weighted portfolio, rebalanced "
    "monthly.\n\n"
    "v1 Archimedes adaptation: 10 trading months ≈ 210 daily bars; we use "
    "a 200-day SMA for tractability on daily data. Single-asset "
    "implementation — portfolio-level weighting across operations is the "
    "responsibility of upstream allocation logic. Cash leg returns are "
    "modeled as zero (conservative); the paper assumes 90-day T-bill "
    "yield."
