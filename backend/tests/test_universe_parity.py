"""Backtest == on-chain universe parity invariant (T1.5).

The on-chain synthetic universe and the backtestable universe MUST stay in
lock-step. Historically they drifted: the on-chain ``SYNTHETICS`` list was a
tuple literal in ``scripts/deploy_contracts.py`` (7 names) while the
backtestable universe lived in ``services.strategy_signal_evaluator.GLOBAL_ASSETS``
(>100 names), with nothing keeping them consistent — a synth could be
deployable but not backtestable, or backtestable but never deployed, and no
test caught it.

This module makes the invariant CI-enforced. Both sides now derive from the
JSON SSOT (``backend/archimedes/data/synthetic_universe.json``); these tests
assert the SSOT-driven on-chain set is consistent with the backtest universe in
both directions, with the single documented exception that single-name equity
synths are intentionally backtest-only pending compliance review.

The invariants:

1. Every on-chain synth is backtestable (on-chain ⊆ GLOBAL_ASSETS).
2. No compliance-flagged single-stock synth is on the live on-chain path.
3. Every backtestable-but-not-on-chain synth is an explained
   compliance-flagged single-stock (the "vice-versa" direction, with its
   audited exception) — so a newly added backtest symbol cannot silently fail
   to reach on-chain unless it was deliberately flagged.
4. The live ``deploy_contracts.SYNTHETICS`` list is exactly the SSOT-derived
   set — i.e. the on-chain deploy path has no hand-edited drift from the SSOT.

These are pure in-memory set comparisons: hermetic, no DB / Redis / RPC / .env.
