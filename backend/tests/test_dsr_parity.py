"""Parity test: backend rigor_evaluator.compute_dsr ≡ analytics-engine compute_dsr.

The fixture/store generator carries its own pure-numpy mirror of the backend DSR
(``analytics-engine/scripts/regen_buy_hold_fixture.py::compute_dsr``) so the
fixture scripts can run without scipy / backend deps. Before #547 the two
implementations used *different Sharpe conventions* — the backend subtracted the
risk-free rate (excess Sharpe), the fixture side did not (raw Sharpe) — so the
same strategy could pass one path and fail the other. #547 canonicalised both on
the excess convention; this test is the guard that keeps them aligned, mirroring
``test_pbo_parity.py``.

Why a tolerance instead of exact ``==`` (as PBO uses): the two paths use
different normal-distribution implementations (backend = scipy; fixture =
Acklam/Zelen-Severo pure-numpy approximations, error < 1.2e-7). Both ``round(…,
6)`` their outputs, so in practice they agree exactly at 6 decimals; the ``1e-6``
tolerance is exactly that rounding granularity and absorbs the rare knife-edge
case without going flaky. A *convention* regression (reverting the fixture side
to raw Sharpe) shifts the p-value by 1e-2 … 7e-1 — thousands of units of this
tolerance — so it is caught decisively.

Hermetic: the fixture module's heavy data/engine imports are deferred into
main(), so importing it pulls only numpy. No scipy needed on the fixture side, no
backtrader / yfinance, no network, no DB.
