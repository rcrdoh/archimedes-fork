        Uses Circle dev-controlled wallet if configured, falls back to raw private key.

        Non-custodial ownership (T0.2 — re-lands the intent of reverted PR #646):
            The deployed ``VaultFactory.createVault`` has a 5-arg selector and
            constructs the Vault with ``Ownable(msg.sender)`` — i.e. the BACKEND
            SIGNER becomes the vault's owner AND (implicitly) its rebalance
            authority. That is custodial: a single compromised backend key could
            re-point the NAV/slippage oracle and bleed the vault.

            #646 tried to fix this by adding a 6th ``address _vaultOwner`` arg to
            ``createVault``, but the on-chain bytecode only has the 5-arg selector,
            so every call reverted and #646 was reverted in full by #650.

            We re-land the SAME non-custodial outcome WITHOUT touching the deployed
            selector or the Vault constructor: right after creation (while the
            backend signer is still owner) we call ``setAgent(backendAgent)`` and
            then ``transferOwnership(owner_wallet)``. Both functions already exist
            in the live Vault ABI, so nothing can mismatch the deployed bytecode.
            The result is ``owner == depositing user`` and ``agent == backend
            signer`` — the agent keeps rebalance-only authority and can never touch
            the owner-only setters (oracles, slippage cap, pause). See
            ``_apply_non_custodial_ownership`` for the owner-resolution policy
            (user wallet → governance address → fail-loud; NEVER silently the agent).

        Args:
            owner_wallet: The depositing user's wallet, which becomes the vault's
                Ownable owner. Pass the SIWE-verified caller for user-facing
                creation. ``None`` is only valid for backend bootstrap/auto-create,

        After ``createVault`` the backend signer is the vault's Ownable owner AND
        the de-facto rebalancer. This method, run by that same signer while it is
        still owner:

          1. ``setAgent(backendAgent)`` — pin the rebalance-only authority to the
             backend signer explicitly (it stays the agent after the handoff).
          2. ``transferOwnership(resolvedOwner)`` — hand the owner role (oracles,
             slippage cap, pause, setAgent) to the depositing user, or to an
             explicit governance key for bootstrap. After this, ``owner != agent``.

        Fail-safe: if no non-agent owner can be resolved (no user wallet AND no
        governance address), we DO NOT transfer ownership — but we log a prominent
        warning. Leaving the freshly-created vault owned by the backend signer is

        bricking a vault by transferring it to a wrong address. Operators see the
        warning and set ARC_VAULT_GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS to close the gap.

        On-chain failures here are logged but NOT raised: the vault already exists
        and is usable; a failed ownership handoff is an operational alert, not a
