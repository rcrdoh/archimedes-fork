"""Strategy runner — paper-grounded strategies drive portfolio decisions.

This IS the intelligence layer. No heuristic regime detector, no equal-weight
guessing — each strategy's published signal rule (SMA200 cross, vol-targeting,
12-month momentum) is evaluated against live market data to produce allocation
signals. Signals are aggregated into target weights, then the executor
rebalances vaults and publishes reasoning trace hashes on-chain.

Run as a standalone process:
    python -m archimedes.chain.agent_runner

Env:
    AGENT_INTERVAL_SECONDS  — tick interval in seconds (default: 300 = 5 min)
    AGENT_DRY_RUN           — if "true", skip on-chain execution (default: false)
    AGENT_VAULT_ADDRESSES   — comma-separated vault addresses to manage
    AGENT_USDC_FLOOR        — minimum USDC allocation, 0.0–1.0 (default: 0.20)
