"""Strategy fusion — multi-paper, user-steered, novelty-seeking synthesis.

A NEW, feature-flagged primitive that sits *beside* `strategy_architect.py`,
not inside it. The architect selects + weights pre-curated single-paper
library strategies (the verified-library path that feeds the strategy-passport
/ reasoning-trace data flow). Fusion does the opposite-direction thing:
synthesizes a *new* strategy hypothesis by fusing >=2 raw arXiv q-fin papers,
steered by the user, optimizing for novelty (McLean & Pontiff 2016: published
alpha decays — the un-decayed edge is combinations not yet in the literature).

Why a separate, flagged module (owner-decided HARD constraint):
- `strategy_architect.py` and the construction-trace path are
  contract-review-grade (the live `ReasoningTraceRegistry`). Fusion is
  additive, behind `ARCHIMEDES_FUSION_ENABLED` (default OFF), and revertible
  by deleting this file + its spec. Nothing in the audited flow is touched.
- The LLM-backend seam, lazy `anthropic` import, `extract_json`, frozen
  artifact and honest-fallback labelling deliberately mirror the architect so
  a later route-wiring is a small, familiar diff.

True-model honesty: our backend is routed through a GLM-backed,
Anthropic-compatible endpoint. `messages.create(model=...)` gets the
*configured* string, but `response.model` is the model that actually served
the request (e.g. `glm-4.7`). The proposal records `response.model` as the
provenance field of record and keeps the configured/requested string
separately. See `docs/specs/strategy-fusion-spec.md`.

paper. Explain why the COMBINATION is non-obvious relative to each paper alone.
- This is a HYPOTHESIS, not validated alpha. Do NOT invent Sharpe ratios, \
returns, or backtest numbers. Do NOT promise or forecast returns. State \
plainly that empirical validation (backtest / DSR / PBO) is pending.
- Respect the user's risk envelope (USYC floor/ceiling, target vol, max DD) \

N with an integer period). Entry/exit conditions use comparison ops (gt, lt, gte, lte) \
or logic ops (and, or, not). Position sizing types: full_invested_when_in_market, \
equal_weight, volatility_target (needs annual_pct). look_ahead_safe MUST be true. \
parameter_variants is OPTIONAL: a dict mapping indicator aliases to 2-8 numeric \
