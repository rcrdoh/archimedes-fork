"""Request/response schemas for the interactive strategy architect.

DELIBERATELY SEPARATE from `api/schemas.py`. That file is the shared
frontend contract Daniel codes against; touching it triggers the
"announce before changing" policy. These models are purely additive — a
new endpoint, no change to any existing shape — so the strategy-architect
work stays unblocked. Fold into `schemas.py` later if/when it stabilizes
and Daniel is building against it.

Endpoint: POST /api/strategies/construct
Owner: Dan. Consumed by: Daniel (strategy-construction UI), and the
reasoning-trace viewer (the trace block here is the same hash that
ITracePublisher anchors on-chain).
