"""Leaderboard API schemas — /api/leaderboard.

The public, gamified strategy leaderboard (North Star §5 — the testnet
engagement engine). It ranks every library strategy by a **transparent**
conviction score built from *real* passport data (rigor gate + backtest), and
pairs that validation axis with a clearly-labelled **forward axis** (per-strategy
StockBench + live paper-P&L) that is honest about what is live now vs pending.

Design rule (the #1 rule — claims must be true): the leaderboard NEVER invents a
number. Every ranking input is a real passport field; the score weights are
explicit and echoed in the response; and the StockBench / live-P&L axis renders
an honest "pending" state per strategy until that data actually flows. (A prior
marketplace surface was removed for "hardcoded fees + invented math", #381 — we
do not repeat that.)
