"""Internal agent authentication guard.

Endpoints that trigger backend-signed on-chain actions or inject system events
must only be callable by the internal agent runner, not by arbitrary public callers.

Usage::

    from archimedes.api.auth_guard import require_internal_agent_key
    from fastapi import Depends

    @router.post("/protected")
    async def endpoint(_: None = Depends(require_internal_agent_key)):
        ...

Set INTERNAL_AGENT_API_KEY in the environment to a random 32-byte hex string
(generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`).

If the env var is unset, all requests are rejected (fail-closed). This avoids
a deploy-time misconfiguration silently leaving internal endpoints open.

User-facing endpoints (e.g. POST /api/vaults/create, POST /api/vaults/metadata)
are deliberately NOT behind this guard — they're signed-by-system on behalf of
a user who arrived via the UI, and the UI cannot carry the internal key. Use
slowapi rate limits for DoS protection on those endpoints instead.
