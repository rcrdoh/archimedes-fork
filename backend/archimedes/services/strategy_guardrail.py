"""Deterministic weight guardrail (Dan's lane, Step 2).

Claude (the Maestro, Step 1) proposes *relative* strategy emphasis. It is told
not to compute auditable numbers. This module is the deterministic Worker that
turns that raw suggestion into a constraint-satisfying allocation:

  - normalize to a valid book that sums to 1.0
  - reserve the risk-profile USYC (cash-yield) floor
  - cap any single strategy's share of the whole portfolio
  - record every adjustment vs. the model's raw proposal

The adjustments log is the point: the Step 3 reasoning trace can say
"Claude proposed 45% to Faber; guardrail capped to 30% and moved 15% to the
cash sleeve" — honest about what the deterministic layer changed, never hidden.

Seam vs. Önder: `IPortfolioConstructor.construct(...)` (math.py) is the real
*asset-level* optimizer — it ranks by risk-adjusted return, optimizes variance,
and maps strategy weights to token allocations using backtest + regime inputs.
This guardrail is the thin strategy-level stand-in for the parts of that the
demo needs (normalize + cap + USYC floor) with no backtest dependency. When
Önder's `construct()` lands it replaces this; `GuardrailResult.strategy_weights`
is the contract both sides speak.
