"""Leaderboard scoring engine — the testnet engagement engine (North Star §5).

Ranks library strategies by a **transparent conviction score** built from *real*
passport data: the rigor gate (DSR / PBO / OOS) plus backtest performance. The
score is a documented weighted sum of four [0,1] inputs — never a black box — and
every input is echoed per-entry so the user sees what drove the rank.

Two axes, honestly separated:
  • Validation axis (LIVE NOW): rigor gate + backtest — real passport fields.
  • Forward axis (PENDING): per-strategy StockBench + live paper-P&L — surfaced
    as honest "pending" until that data flows, so the engine visibly *pairs*
    them with validation (per Dan's call) without inventing values.

This module is pure: it takes ``StrategyResponse`` objects and returns schema
objects. No DB, no network — trivially unit-testable.
