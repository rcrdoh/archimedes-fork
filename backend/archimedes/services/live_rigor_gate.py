"""Live rigor-gate badge — the single source of truth for ``passes_rigor_gate``.

Issue #821. The user-facing library badge (``passes_rigor_gate`` and the
CANDIDATE → VALIDATED 🏆 promotion) must come from a LIVE ``run_rigor_gate``
verdict computed on the strategy's *persisted real returns*, NOT from a stored
fixture boolean. A cached boolean that the gate never re-derives is exactly the
pattern the #1 rule forbids ("claims must be true on the live path") and the one
Bogdan's audit (#710) flagged.

This module reuses the SAME machinery the ``/api/selection-bias/gate`` route
uses — ``get_all_daily_returns`` (real persisted returns from the DB) +
``run_rigor_gate`` (the four-primitive gate) — so the library list and the gate
route share one source of truth. It deliberately does NOT synthesize returns
from stubs: a strategy with no real backtest data surfaces an explicit
``pending`` verdict, never a fixture ``True``/``False``.

Tri-state result (``RigorGateVerdict``):
  - ``"pass"``    — real returns exist and the live gate passed.
  - ``"fail"``    — real returns exist and the live gate failed at ≥1 criterion.
  - ``"pending"`` — no real returns yet (genuinely pre-backtest): the gate cannot
                    run, so the badge is honestly "unknown", not a boolean.

Cheap-by-default: ``passes`` is ``True`` only for ``"pass"``; ``"pending"`` and
``"fail"`` both map to ``passes is False`` so existing boolean consumers stay
fail-closed.
