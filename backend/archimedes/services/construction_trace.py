"""Construction reasoning-trace builder (Dan's lane — Step 3).

Assembles a `ReasoningTrace` for an interactive strategy-construction request
and computes its integrity hash. This is the provenance artifact that makes
Archimedes' core claim real: every allocation the agent proposes is recorded,
hashed, and independently verifiable.

Hard seam — this module STOPS at the hash. It never touches the chain.
Publishing the hash to `ReasoningTraceRegistry` is Chuan/Marten's
`ITracePublisher.publish(trace)`; this returns a `ReasoningTrace` with
`trace_hash` populated and `arc_tx_hash=None` for them to anchor.

Honesty rules carried through from Steps 1–2:
- No fabricated `confidence`. There is no calibrated source for it yet
  (it should come from the backtest / DSR layer once that lands), so it is
  left at 0.0 and the absence is stated in `expected_outcome`. Inventing a
  number here would contradict the whole selection-bias thesis.
- The regime is recorded as explicitly unknown when detection isn't wired,
  never guessed.
