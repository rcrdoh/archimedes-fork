"""Wallet-less generation quota — a strict per-IP daily cap (anti-abuse).

The Generate path is intentionally **open** (`REQUIRE_SIWE_FOR_GENERATION` off) so
visitors — humans *and* agents — can try the product before connecting a wallet
(value-before-wallet, #787). But an open LLM-spending endpoint is a flood/abuse
risk: an agent in a loop could hammer `/api/generate/start` and burn LLM budget.

This module caps **wallet-less** generations to a small daily allowance per client
IP. Authenticated (SIWE-wallet) callers bypass the cap entirely. When the cap is
hit we return HTTP 429 with a steering payload — so the cap doubles as a
**conversion prompt** ("connect a wallet to keep generating") rather than a dead
end.

Defense in depth: this sits *on top of* the existing slowapi per-route limit
(`5/minute`) and the nginx `limit_req_zone` per-IP limits — those bound the burst
*rate*; this bounds the wallet-less *daily volume*.

Rigor + keying:
  - Keyed on the **real client IP**, read from the `X-Real-IP` header that nginx
    sets from its `real_ip`-resolved `$remote_addr`. nginx overwrites any
    client-supplied value and binds `real_ip_header` to the trusted ALB CIDR, so
    this header is not client-spoofable. (Uvicorn runs without `--proxy-headers`,
    so `request.client.host` is nginx, not the client — hence we read the header.)
  - IP-keyed on purpose: an agent that drops the anonymous `archimedes_vid` cookie
    would defeat a cookie-keyed cap. A sophisticated IP-rotating abuser is out of
    scope for this MVP cap (the slowapi + nginx limits remain the rate backstop).

Fail-open: a Redis error returns "allowed" (logged at WARNING). Blocking every
wallet-less generation during a Redis blip would be worse than the narrow abuse
window, and the slowapi/nginx rate limits remain in force regardless. Set
`WALLET_LESS_GENERATION_DAILY_CAP=0` to disable the cap (unlimited).
