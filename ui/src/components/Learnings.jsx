          Strategies you've deployed — winners and losers, both first-class — with the

          This page populates as you deploy strategies into vaults and time accumulates
          performance + reasoning data. To get started:

        <ol className="pl-5 leading-loose">
          <li><strong>Generate</strong> a strategy from the <a href="/generate" onClick={goGenerate} className="text-[var(--accent)]">Generate</a> page.</li>
          <li>Connect your wallet and <strong>deploy it into a vault</strong> before the
            strategy expires — generated strategies are <strong>time-bound</strong> to the
            market context captured at generation time, so they go stale.</li>
          <li>Come back here over time to see how each strategy is doing, and click through
            to the agent's reasoning at each decision point.</li>
        </ol>

          On time-bound strategies: each Generate result captures the live regime + signals
          as its frame of reference. Deploy windows enforce that a strategy keyed to
          Tuesday's market context can't be executed on Friday — if you miss the window,
          regenerate. Server-side enforcement of expiry is on the roadmap
          (<code>docs/specs/strategy-expiry-spec.md</code>, to be drafted).

          so generated-but-not-acted-on strategies stay visible with their original
          reasoning for post-hoc inspection.
