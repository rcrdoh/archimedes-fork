// for each. Honest empty state until strategies accumulate runtime data.

          The intent: surface the strategies you've deployed — winners and losers,
          both first-class — with the agent's reasoning available for each rebalance.
          Develop your own intuition rather than treat the system as a black box.

          Why it isn't live yet: the rebalance-trace history needs to accumulate
          before per-strategy winner/loser splits become meaningful. The data
          model and reasoning surface are in place (see <a
            href="/reasoning"
            onClick={(e) => { e.preventDefault(); onNavigate?.('reasoning') }}
            style={{ color: 'var(--accent)' }}
          >Reasoning</a>); the per-strategy aggregation view lands after the
          hackathon as a thin layer on top.

          Losing trades are not hidden when this lands. Silently rotating away from
          losses is the failure mode of every "AI fund" — we explicitly don't.

          The regime is the agent's read of market conditions, derived from VIX +
          SPX moving-average cross signals. It biases strategy selection —
          <em>Calm</em> leans into momentum + TSMOM,
          <em> Crisis</em> leans into t-bill alternatives + capital preservation.
          The four regimes are defined in full below.

            strategy expires — generated strategies are <strong>time-bound</strong> to the
            market context captured at generation time, so they go stale.</li>
          <li>Come back here over time to see how each strategy is doing, and click through
            to the agent's reasoning at each decision point.</li>

          On time-bound strategies: each Generate result captures the live regime + signals
          as its frame of reference. Deploy windows enforce that a strategy keyed to
          Tuesday's market context can't be executed on Friday — if you miss the window,
          regenerate. Server-side enforcement of expiry is on the roadmap.
