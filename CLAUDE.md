## Project

**Archimedes** — "Linus for quantitative finance": a single-user agent that turns the
q-fin research literature into investable, rigor-gated strategies, then executes and
monitors them in non-custodial vaults on Arc with USDC settlement. The product spine
(generate → rigor-gate → execute → monitor → explore) is locked in
[`docs/user-stories.md`](docs/user-stories.md) — the canonical product framing.

> *"Give me a lever long enough and I shall move the world."* The lever here is academic
> research; the fulcrum is autonomous AI; the world is your portfolio.

Built for the [**Agora Agents Hackathon**](https://luma.com/7i50p2r9) — Canteen × Circle × Arc,
May 11–25, 2026.

- Repository: [`github.com/a-apin/archimedes`](https://github.com/a-apin/archimedes)
- Discord: **Archimedes Arcadia** server
- Branch model: **`main` is the single live branch — build-on-deploy.** Every merge to
  `main` triggers a CI build + deploy to the live EC2 stack. No `develop`/integration
  branch (retired 2026-05-18, unused). Short-lived per-owner branches
  (`dbrowneup/<name>`, `marten`, …) → PR → merge to `main`; `main` moves continuously
  (the agentic system `t2o2` lands + self-iterates on it; Dan + Claude Code now drive the
  core build), so rebase late and merge fast
- Live testnet deploy: [`https://archimedes-arc.com/`](https://archimedes-arc.com/) (CloudFront → EC2,
  Chain ID `5042002` / `0x4cef52`, Arc testnet). **Prod migrated 2026-06-24 to Dan's own AWS
  account (`037613907429` / `us-east-1`)** — see "Project / Status" below. The old `.app` domain
  was decommissioned 2026-06-24 (its `.app`/`.com` split had caused the Circle passkey rpId bug,
  since fixed); `.com` is the sole live domain.

### Project / Status (refreshed 2026-06-24 — Lepton Sprint)

Post-Agora, the team is in the **Lepton Sprint** (→ Jun 29 + a post-event funding/grant/
acquisition track). The current build sequence, full tier breakdown, and Lepton scoring map
live in **`ARCHIMEDES-ROADMAP-v3.md`** (a team artifact pending consolidation into `docs/`
under roadmap T3.3 — not yet committed at a fixed in-repo path; ask Dan if you can't find
it). The headlines a fresh session needs:

- **Live + infra.** App is live at [`https://archimedes-arc.com`](https://archimedes-arc.com)
  (CloudFront → nginx → EC2). The prod stack was **rebuilt on Dan's own AWS account
  (`037613907429` / `us-east-1`)**, decoupled from the prior shared account. **GitHub Actions
  auto-deploy is re-pointed and ON** — every merge to `main` rebuilds + redeploys.
- **LLM.** **AWS Bedrock is the live LLM** — **Amazon Nova Micro** default via a multi-provider
  **Converse** backend, with a model cost-picker on the Generate page. (GLM is removed from prod;
  BYOK and a local-Ollama single-user path are preserved.) `response.model` is the
  provenance of record across the GLM→Bedrock migration.
- **Current focus = claim integrity, then the core vertical.** **Tier 0 — Claim Integrity**
  makes every UI/pitch claim true on the live path (unify the rigor gate; owner ≠ agent
  non-custodial vaults; real commit-reveal + IPFS provenance; runtime backtest in the request
  path; loud fallback telemetry) — *building flashy work on a fake-strict rigor badge is
  building on sand.* Then **Tier 1 — the core Lepton vertical**: multi-agent (TradingAgents-style)
  engine with N>1 diverse candidates, an optional-publish nanopayment marketplace (x402/Gateway,
  sub-cent USDC), a Chainlink-first oracle, IPFS provenance, and on-chain↔backtest universe parity + 5–10×.
- **Lepton scoring map.** Tier 0 + the multi-agent engine → Agentic Sophistication (30%);
  nanopayments → Circle tools (20%) + Traction (30%); provenance + Chainlink + Xia rigor →
  Innovation (20%). Only post-May-25 work + new traction count (the Agora-delta rule).
- **Hard constraint above all.** *Claims must be true.* Every guarantee the UI/pitch/grant
  makes (rigor, non-custodial, on-chain provenance) must be backed by the live path, not a
  fixture or a cached boolean — this is the #1 rule, and the thing Bogdan's audit (PR #710)
  showed we were violating.

Status drafts (Circle grant, Lepton submission) live alongside the roadmap as team
artifacts; treat them as drafts (a few still carry the stale `.app` URL pending Dan's
edit) — the roadmap is the authoritative status.

## North Star

A user with idle USDC who wants thoughtful portfolio management — but is tired of black-box
robo-advisors, opaque AI funds, and "trust me bro" influencer copy-trading — **describes
what they want**, and Archimedes **generates** a research-grounded strategy, **rigor-gates**
it (DSR/PBO — the curation protocol that makes the library trustworthy), **executes** it
into a non-custodial vault, then lets them **monitor** results and **explore** their
compounding strategy library. Every position, rebalance, and regime shift comes with a
**paper-grounded reasoning trace anchored on-chain** — hashed and verifiable. Single-user
is the MVP; a social network of shared strategies is the roadmap vision (canonical detail
in [`docs/user-stories.md`](docs/user-stories.md)).

The Agora narrative frames this:

> *Where AI agents make markets. The agora was where Athens did its thinking out loud.
> Markets are still doing the same job today; they are the social technology by which a
> civilization aggregates knowledge and decides what things are worth. AI agents are the new
> citizens.*

Archimedes is one such citizen — but one whose reasoning trail is open to inspection, whose
claimed alpha is bound to academic research rather than vibes, and whose settlement happens
at sub-second finality on Arc with USDC. The mathematician's name is fitting: he was the
original empiricist working from first principles. We work from peer-reviewed first
principles.

## Team (~20-year age span; coverage on every load-bearing skill)

> Roster note (2026-06-24): the team grew through the Lepton community and Chuan is
> stepping back; the table below lists the core contributors as of this revision.

Roughly balanced bios. Ages are author estimates pending team confirmation. Discord handles
in parentheses; the human handles are what shows up in the channel.

> **Lanes are descriptive of strengths, not prescriptive of boundaries.** The "Role"
> column and the load-bearing-component table below describe where each teammate has
> the deepest context, not who is *allowed* to work on what. Everyone is a full-stack
> contributor; we all routinely work across lanes when the situation calls for it. The

> memory on a given subsystem — not to gate who can drive work forward. **This applies

Two team members (Dan, Daniel R) have demanding day roles and commit evenings/weekends.
Marten and Önder are students with flexible time. (Chuan ran a real startup and treated the
hackathon as serious focus; he is now stepping back — see the ownership note above.)

**Daily sync window:** 13:00 UTC = 8am Chicago / 10am São Paulo / 14:00 London / 15:00
Bremen / 16:00 Ankara. Works across the whole team without anyone in unsocial hours.

**Schedule/flow owner:** Marten (showing coordinator instincts since Day 1). Standups in
`#standups` in Discord.

### Non-team contacts

- **Anuhya** (Discord: `moonshot` in the Canteen server, *NOT* the Chuan-moonshot in
  Archimedes Arcadia) is a **Canteen admin** running the hackathon. She is a stakeholder /
  judge-adjacent, not a teammate.

### Lead + coverage by load-bearing component

The "Lead" column names who has the deepest context and is the default reviewer; the
"Coverage" column names who can step in. **Neither column is a permission gate.** Anyone
on the team — and any AI agent operating on their behalf — is welcome to drive work in
any of these areas; the table just signals whose review-eyes will most likely be needed
and who has the longest memory. Specifically: **do not refuse or close a task because it
sits outside your nominal lane.** If the task is assigned to you, execute it; flag the
cross-lane review need in the PR description so the right teammate sees it.

| Component                                          | Lead             | Coverage              |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Strategy engine + Q-fin paper corpus curation       | Dan              | Önder                 |
| Backtesting / strategy-passport math + risk pricing | Önder            | Dan                   |
| Backend Python layer (FastAPI, API, services, models) | Daniel R.      | Marten                |
| On-chain integration layer (`backend/archimedes/chain/`, oracle runner) | Dan | Bogdan / Marten |
| Frontend (React + Vite + viem, wallet UX, trade tab) | Marten (current) / Daniel R. | Dan       |
| Smart contracts (Arc, Foundry, 11 deployed)         | Dan              | Bogdan (`mnemonik-dev`) / Marten |
| Infra / EC2 / CI/CD / docker-compose / AWS account  | Dan              | Daniel R.             |
| Architecture + design decisions                     | Dan (lead)       | full team             |
| Pitch deck + demo script + Claude Design + judging  | Dan              | Marten                |

**Ownership transition (2026-06-24):** Chuan formerly led on-chain integration, smart
contracts, infra, and architecture; with Chuan stepping back, **Dan now owns all four** —
he holds the new AWS account and deploys the contracts himself. **Bogdan (`mnemonik-dev`)
is the preferred contract reviewer** (he ran the PR #710 audit and is on the provenance /
commit-reveal + IPFS work, issue #714); Marten remains a backup on the on-chain layer.
`api/` + `services/` + `models/` + `interfaces/` under `backend/archimedes/` remain led by
Daniel R.; the `chain/` subdirectory is now Dan's lead. Both layers share the
`backend/archimedes/` Python package and the FastAPI app boots them together via `main.py`.
Marten currently has the most recent commits on the React UI as he comes up to speed on what
the team has built. Cross-lane contributions are the norm, not the exception — the leads
listed above are reviewers and memory-carriers, not gatekeepers.

## Setup

Read [`README.md`](README.md) for the full setup walkthrough — Python conda env via
[`environment.yml`](environment.yml), Node.js frontend, Foundry for contracts, the
[arc-canteen CLI](https://github.com/the-canteen-dev/ARC-cli) for traction tracking,
and a Docker-compose-driven local stack that mirrors the production EC2 deployment.
Platform-specific notes for macOS / Linux / Windows (Önder on macOS; WSL2 recommended for Marten).

**Spinning up locally is one command** once `.env` is filled in:

```bash
cp .env.example .env       # fill in ANTHROPIC_API_KEY + RPC at minimum
docker compose up -d --build
```

Then <http://localhost> for the UI mockups and <http://localhost:8000/docs> for the
backend API. See README § "Run Archimedes locally" for the full walkthrough.

**The whole toolchain lives in the `archimedes` conda env — including Node.**
`python` / `pytest` / `ruff` **and** `node` / `npm` / the `ui/` ESLint all come
from the `archimedes` env; **none are on the base shell PATH.** A bare
`command -v node` returning nothing does *not* mean Node is missing — it means
the env isn't on PATH. Activate the env, or use its binaries directly. For a
non-interactive shell (CI, or an agent's Bash tool), prepend the env's bin so
the ESLint shebang can resolve Node:

```bash
export PATH="$(conda info --base)/envs/archimedes/bin:$PATH"
node --version            # v26.x ; npm 11.x
cd ui && npm run lint     # or scoped: ./node_modules/.bin/eslint src/<file>
```

**Tests:** from the repo root in the `archimedes` conda env, just `pytest` —
`pytest.ini` sets `pythonpath`/`testpaths` and a verbose default (~1400 backend
`def test_` cases on `main` as of 2026-06-13; suite is still growing). Coverage:
`pytest --cov=archimedes --cov-report=term-missing`. The
analytics-engine runs its own suite: `cd analytics-engine && uv run pytest`. See
README § "Running the test suite" for the honest coverage picture and the
build-on-deploy integration-test caveat. See also "Testing conventions" in
Engineering conventions for the hermetic-test standard.

**AWS account access (added 2026-05-27; updated 2026-06-24 — new account/region):**
Prod now lives on **Dan's own AWS account (`037613907429`) in `us-east-1`** (migrated
2026-06-24 off the prior shared account). Team members who need to verify AWS
infrastructure (security review, dashboard checks, SSM access to the live EC2,
Aurora port-forwarding) should ask **Dan** (the AWS account owner) for an IAM
user with the AWS managed policies `SecurityAudit` + `ViewOnlyAccess`, MFA
required on first login, and the access key + secret delivered via a secure
channel (1Password / Bitwarden / Signal — never Discord, never email).

Local setup:
```bash
brew install awscli
mkdir -p ~/.aws && chmod 700 ~/.aws
aws configure --profile archimedes
# region: us-east-1 ; output: json
chmod 600 ~/.aws/credentials
export AWS_PROFILE=archimedes
aws sts get-caller-identity   # smoke-test (account 037613907429)
```

For SSM admin access to the live EC2 (replaces SSH, no port 22 needed):
```bash
aws ssm start-session --target i-<instance-id> --region us-east-1
# Aurora port forward (after Aurora/ElastiCache cutover — T3.5):
aws ssm start-session --target i-<instance-id> --region us-east-1 \
  --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSessionToRemoteHost \
  --parameters host=<aurora-endpoint>,portNumber=5432,localPortNumber=5432
```

Optional hardening: `brew install aws-vault` to store credentials in Keychain
instead of plaintext `~/.aws/credentials`. Long-term plan is to migrate to AWS
IAM Identity Center (no long-lived access keys) once the team is past
hackathon scale.

## External references — submodules

The repo carries three git submodules at [`submodules/`](submodules/):

- **[`submodules/context-arc/`](submodules/context-arc/)** — Circle's agent-facing
  developer docs and 5 reference codebases for Arc + Circle. **This is the canonical
  reference for any Arc/Circle integration question.** Start with
  [`submodules/context-arc/AGENTS.md`](submodules/context-arc/AGENTS.md) for the
  task-indexed entry-point table. Highest-leverage files for our build:
    - `circlefin-skills/use-arc.md` — Arc chain config, USDC-as-gas, Foundry deploy (canonical Arc reference)
    - `circlefin-skills/use-smart-contract-platform.md` — contract deploy + monitor (Dan's lane; Bogdan reviews)
    - `circlefin-skills/bridge-stablecoin.md` — CCTP + Gateway for RWA bridging (Marten's lane)
    - `circlefin-skills/use-gateway.md` — unified balance + nanopayments
    - `samples/arc-escrow/` — closest existing pattern to our vault contract
    - `samples/arc-multichain-wallet/` — CCTP integration patterns
    - `samples/arc-p2p-payments/` — Paymaster + USDC patterns
  Refresh upstream with `git submodule update --remote submodules/context-arc` or
  `arc-canteen context sync` (drops into `~/.arc-canteen/context/`).

  **Sticky submodule config — one-time, per clone:** after `git clone`, run this
  to make git auto-recurse into submodules on every checkout/pull/rebase. Without
  this, working trees drift out of sync with main's recorded pins (we hit this
  several times during the hackathon — every session had to manually re-sync):
  ```bash
  git config submodule.recurse true   # auto-recurse on git ops
  git config diff.submodule log       # nicer diff display
  git submodule update --init --recursive  # one-shot sync to recorded pins
  ```
  Linus has its OWN nested submodule (`submodules/Linus/modules/KnowledgeBase`)
  which is the most common source of "modified content" noise in `git status`.
  The `--recursive` flag handles it.
- **[`submodules/KnowledgeBase/`](submodules/KnowledgeBase/)** — Dan's scientific-
  paper analysis pipeline (PyMuPDF extract + SPECTER2 embeddings + HDBSCAN/BERTopic
  clustering + REBEL/SciSpacy knowledge graph). For Archimedes, **don't port wholesale**
  — read it as a reference implementation. The patterns worth lifting for the
  Tier-1 arxiv extraction pipeline:
    - `papers_analysis/extract.py` — PyMuPDF caching pattern (~71 files/s)
    - `papers_analysis/metadata.py` — paper-corpus schema (maps to our `paper_corpus` table)
    - `papers_analysis/summarize.py` — Ollama-driven methodology synthesis (we'd use Claude)

  **KB pipeline integration — provenance discipline:** The Corpus page (`/corpus`)
  uses [`corpus_routes.py`](backend/archimedes/api/corpus_routes.py) at the
  `/api/corpus/*` prefix, which reads real KB pipeline output (SPECTER2
  embeddings, HDBSCAN clusters, REBEL/SciSpacy triples) and returns 503 when no
  artifact exists yet. The legacy metadata-derived `/api/papers/corpus/*`
  endpoints were deleted in issue #201 — do NOT reintroduce them. Any "graph"
  or "knowledge graph" surface MUST come from real KB pipeline output, not
  arxiv-metadata synthesis. When the KB pipeline (issue #151, gated on AWS
  infra #147) actually produces an artifact, the honest endpoints start
  returning data; until then the page renders an explicit "KB pipeline still
  running — first artifact pending" empty state from the 503 response.
- **[`submodules/Linus/`](submodules/Linus/)** — Dan's personal AI orchestration
  project. Reference only; nothing to port to Archimedes. The
  [`experiments/archimedes/`](submodules/Linus/experiments/archimedes/) and
  [`experiments/agora-hackathon/`](submodules/Linus/experiments/agora-hackathon/)
  directories contain the priors that seeded several of our current `docs/` files.

## arc-canteen CLI — telemetry surface for the 30% Traction weight

Every teammate authenticates individually (`arc-canteen login` → GitHub device flow).
The CLI is two things in one binary:

1. A **per-developer Arc-testnet RPC proxy.** `arc-canteen rpc <method>` proxies JSON-RPC
   calls through Canteen's server. The per-user `swrm_*` token in `~/.arc-canteen/env`
   authenticates. Allowlist: most reads + `eth_sendRawTransaction`. **The full RPC URL
   is a secret — see README § "Understanding the RPC URL" for the threat model.**
2. The **traction telemetry surface that the rubric reads.** Every meaningful product
   ship should be paired with an `arc-canteen update-product` call; every user we
   onboard or even talk to should be logged via `arc-canteen update-traction`. The
   30% Traction score is computed from this telemetry, not from anywhere else. **Until
   we start logging, the rubric reads zero.** See
   [`docs/judging-rubric-assessment.md`](docs/judging-rubric-assessment.md) for where we
   currently stand.

`arc-canteen status` shows your current dashboard — what the judges see.

## Tech Stack

Refer to [`docs/design.md` § 6](docs/design.md) for the full table. Headline choices as
they actually shipped (Day 4):

- **Backend:** Python 3.12 / FastAPI / Uvicorn, packaged as `backend/archimedes/` with
  subpackages `api/` (routes), `chain/` (on-chain integration + oracle runner),
  `interfaces/` (frozen Protocol classes), `models/` (Strategy, BacktestResult,
  ReasoningTrace, Portfolio dataclasses), `services/` (LocalStrategyProvider etc.)
- **Frontend:** React 19 + Vite 8 + viem 2.48 + plain CSS. Lives at [`ui/`](ui/) (the
  earlier `ui-mockups/` static-HTML directory was retired and removed from the tree in
  issue #461). Components shipped: `Layout`, `WalletConnect` (MetaMask / Coinbase /
  generic browser wallet), `Trade`
- **Analytics engine:** [`analytics-engine/`](analytics-engine/) — uv-managed Python
  package with the backtrader runner. Loads strategy files from
  [`analytics-engine/strategies/`](analytics-engine/strategies/)
- **DB:** PostgreSQL + Redis (Postgres for strategies + backtests; Redis for live regime
  state)
- **LLM:** **AWS Bedrock (live in prod since 2026-06-24)** for strategy extraction,
  reasoning trace generation, and user-facing explanations — **Amazon Nova Micro** is the
  default via a multi-provider **Converse** backend, with a model cost-picker on the
  Generate page; the two Anthropic-on-Bedrock models (Haiku 4.5 / Sonnet 4.6) are pending
  AWS use-case activation (roadmap T3.8) before the paid tier (T1.8) has real models behind
  it. GLM is removed from prod; **BYOK and a local-Ollama single-user path are preserved.**
  `response.model` is the provenance of record across the GLM→Bedrock migration.
  (`.env.example` still defaults `LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic_compatible` — that's stale vs the
  live `bedrock_converse`/Nova default and is tracked as roadmap T3.10.)
- **Backtesting:** [backtrader](https://github.com/mementum/backtrader) for v1 per
  [`docs/adr/backtrader-vs-vectorbt-decision-memo.md`](docs/adr/backtrader-vs-vectorbt-decision-memo.md).
  Supersedes `docs/design.md` § 6 ("vectorbt / custom numpy engine") on this one
  line; design.md remains the architecture spec for everything else. Migration to
  vectorbt is a v2 problem if parameter-sweep speed becomes a constraint.
- **Smart contracts:** Solidity + Foundry, targeting Arc (EVM-compatible). **11 contracts
  deployed on Arc testnet** (Day 4 baseline + `StrategyRegistry` added later):
  `AMMPool`, `AMMRouter`, `AssetRegistry`, `PriceOracle`, `ReasoningTraceRegistry`,
  `StrategyRegistry`, `SyntheticFactory`, `SyntheticToken`, `SyntheticVault`,
  `Vault`, `VaultFactory`. ABIs cached in
  [`contracts/abis/`](contracts/abis/) for backend + UI consumption. (Note:
  `ecosystem-design-spec.md` described `StrategyRegistry → AssetRegistry` as a
  replacement, but in practice both coexist today — the spec-vs-state delta
  is intentional and the registries serve different lookups.)
- **On-chain integration:** Circle SDK — Wallets (Circle-managed wallet for the oracle
  signer), USYC, Gateway, CCTP, Paymaster; viem on the UI side
- **Deployment:** Docker compose stack (postgres / redis / nginx / oracle / backend) on an
  EC2 instance behind nginx, fronted by CloudFront. **Runs on Dan's own AWS account
  (`037613907429` / `us-east-1`) as of 2026-06-24.** CI/CD via GitHub Actions per
  [`docs/infra-setup.md`](docs/infra-setup.md) — **auto-deploy is re-pointed and ON**, so every
  merge to `main` rebuilds + redeploys. Live at
  [`https://archimedes-arc.com/`](https://archimedes-arc.com/). (Aurora + ElastiCache TF is
  provisioned but the cutover off in-stack Postgres/Redis is still pending — roadmap T3.5.)

## Scope — the headline commitments

Refer to [`docs/archive/mvp-scope-memo.md`](docs/archive/mvp-scope-memo.md) for the full argument. Locked
decisions (5 of them as of Day 3):

1. **Primary RFB:** [RFB 04 — Adaptive Portfolio Manager](https://luma.com/7i50p2r9).
   Adjacent: RFB 02 (Kelly/+EV math primitive); RFB 06 (strategy leaderboard).
2. **Both on-chain stories:** vault contracts for portfolio allocation **and** the
   ReasoningTraceRegistry for verifiable provenance. Both shipping.
3. **Curated v1 strategy library:** 5–10 hand-curated quant strategies; arxiv ingest
   pipeline runs as a demo feature on 2–3 papers, not relied on for live decisions.
4. **(Day 3) Rigor is the wedge.** Every Tier-1 strategy passes the four selection-bias
   controls (DSR + PBO + walk-forward OOS + look-ahead audit) before admission to the
   library. Paper-claim deltas are surfaced honestly, not hidden behind an aggregate
   score. See [`docs/specs/selection-bias-corrections-spec.md`](docs/specs/selection-bias-corrections-spec.md).
5. **(Day 3) Two-tier marketplace.** Tier 1 (Archimedes Verified 🏆) = paper-grounded +
   selection-bias-corrected + full agent autonomy. Tier 2 (Community 👥) = permissionless,
   opt-in agent features. Per [`docs/specs/ecosystem-design-spec.md`](docs/specs/ecosystem-design-spec.md).
- **Demo vertical:** portfolio construction + autonomous rebalancing on Arc, NOT trading-
  agent-as-product. Per [`docs/architectural-principles.md`](docs/architectural-principles.md),
  the wedge is verifiable history + paper-grounded provenance + selection-bias rigor.
- **Out of scope:** see [`docs/anti-features.md`](docs/anti-features.md), including the
  Day-3 "pitch-rigor anti-claims" section that constrains the deck framing.

## Engineering conventions

### Branch model (build-on-deploy, main-only)

Codified 2026-05-18 to match how the team actually works (see
"Working with AI agents on this repo" below):

- **`main` is the only long-lived branch, and it is the deploy branch.** Every merge
  to `main` triggers a CI build + deploy to the live EC2 stack. There is no
  `develop`/integration branch — it drifted unused and was retired.
- **`main` moves continuously.** The agentic system (`t2o2`) merges work and iterates on
  its own CI failures directly on `main`, and Dan + Claude Code drive the core build in
  parallel sessions. Treat `main` as fast-moving: branch from it late, rebase onto it right
  before merging, and merge in a tight window before it drifts again. Don't wait for it to
  "settle" — it won't.
- Short-lived per-owner branches `<discord-handle>/<short-name>` → PR → merge to
  `main`. Delete the branch after merge.
- **Merge commits only (codified 2026-05-27).** Squash-merge and rebase-merge are
  disabled in repo settings. Use `gh pr merge <n> --merge` or the GitHub UI's
  "Create a merge commit" option. Why: merge commits preserve branch topology,
  making `git log --merges` and `git log --graph` show unit-of-work boundaries
  clearly. Rebase-merge confuses `git branch --merged` (the rewritten commits
  aren't ancestors of `main` anymore) and loses the "this was a single PR" signal
  needed for post-hoc forensics.
- **The few hard rules — universal, and they do not impede speed:** never force-push
  `main`; never commit secrets or `.env`; one logical change per PR. Force-pushing
  your *own* unmerged feature branch is fine and expected (rebase-before-merge).
- On-chain / smart-contract changes still warrant **Dan's eyes (the contract/infra owner),
  with Bogdan as the preferred second reviewer**, given live-funds risk.

### PR reviews

For a 5-person hackathon team operating async across 5 timezones, **one approving review**
is enough for non-contract changes. Contract changes get two. Reviewers should respond
within ~12 hours during the hackathon so the contributor isn't blocked overnight.

### Commit style

Imperative mood ("Add strategy passport schema" not "Added strategy passport schema").
Scope tags optional but encouraged: `[strategy]`, `[backtest]`, `[contracts]`, `[frontend]`,
`[infra]`, `[docs]`. Atomic commits — one logical change per commit; don't bundle.

### CI / quality gates

Four workflows run on every PR and every push to `main`:

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `quality-gate.yml` | PR → main | Hard block: `pytest -m "not integration"` (unit suite, no DB/Redis) **and** `ruff-gate` (`ruff format --check .` + `ruff check --select E9,F63,F7,F40 .`). Informational: full `ruff check` (broader rule set) + `npm run lint` in `ui/` — both run with `continue-on-error` and their pass/fail counts are posted as a PR comment table (marker `<!-- quality-gate-v1 -->`). Agent PRs (`t2o2`) also get a coverage gate (≥ 60%). |
| `complexity-gate.yml` | PR → main (Python/JS/TS files only) | Aggregate cyclomatic-complexity, nesting depth, recursion, and orphan analysis via lizard + Python AST. Compares the changed-file set against the `main` baseline and posts a table comment on the PR (marker `<!-- complexity-gate-v1 -->`). **Informational only — never blocks merge.** Runs on the GitHub runner with `pip install lizard`; the bundled distroless Dockerfile at `.github/docker/complexity-gate/Dockerfile` is available for local use but not pulled by CI. |
| `deploy.yml` | push → main | Rebuilds and redeploys the EC2 stack. |
| `main-format-guard.yml` | push → main | Runs `ruff format --check .` on every push to `main`. If the check fails, the workflow runs `ruff format .`, commits the fix back with `[skip ci]` (no recursion), and fails its own run so the violation is visible in CI history. Net effect: `main` self-heals so open PRs aren't stranded with red ruff-gates, and the failed run nudges the contributor (or agent) to install pre-commit. Added 2026-05-25 after several rounds of direct-to-main pushes landed unformatted files. |
| `release-tag.yml` | push → main | Creates a semver annotated tag for every merged PR via the GitHub API (no `git push`). Bump rules (read from PR title only, **end-of-title anchor**): `!version-release` → major (1.0.0), `!minor` → minor (0.1.0), anything else → patch (0.0.1). Title-end matching prevents false positives where the marker text appears in body prose. Direct pushes with no associated PR are skipped silently. |

**Complexity gate visual thresholds (informational only — none block merge):** ✅ CC 1–5 simple · ⚠️ 6–10 moderate · 🟠 11–15 complex · 🔴 16+. Δ CC > +1.0 vs main is flagged ⚠️. Nesting depth ≥ 3 and recursive functions are flagged in the table.

**Release tag markers:**
```
PR title: "Rework strategy fusion engine !minor"     → v0.1.0
PR title: "Launch-ready rebalancer !version-release" → v1.0.0
PR title: "Fix corpus manifest path"                 → v0.0.1
```

**Release tagging — conventions for direct-to-main commits (applies especially to
bot-driven work):** `release-tag.yml` only fires on PR merges. **Direct pushes to
`main` without an associated PR are silently skipped — no tag is created.** Two
implications:

1. **Prefer PRs over direct push** for any change that warrants a version tag (i.e.
   anything except trivial doc fixes you'd be comfortable losing in `git log`).
   This includes work done by the agentic system (`t2o2`): if a change is
   meaningful enough to read later, it's meaningful enough to PR.
2. **Choose the right marker for the PR title.** Most changes are patches and
   need no marker. But:
   - **`!minor`** — new user-facing capability (new endpoint, new UI surface,
     new strategy in the library, new contract method, new pipeline stage).
   - **`!version-release`** — major milestones (live demo cutover, multi-chain
     mainnet, custodial-vault → non-custodial-vault migration, etc.). Use
     sparingly — most weeks see zero of these.
   - **(no marker)** — bug fixes, refactors, doc updates, dep bumps, telemetry.

When in doubt, default to **no marker** (patch). Over-bumping minor/major dilutes
the signal; under-bumping is recoverable later.

### Testing conventions (codified 2026-05-27)

Hard-won during the post-hackathon test-coverage push and the env-flaky-test
sweep. **CI green ≠ local green** is itself a bug; tests must pass identically
in both environments. Read this before writing any new test.

- **Tests must be hermetic.** No `.env` dependence, no live Redis / Postgres /
  Anthropic / Arc RPC. CI runs without `.env` or those services; tests that pass
  in CI but fail locally (or vice versa) are real bugs that need fixing, not
  flaky tests to be skip-marked. The hermetic gate: `env -i HOME=$HOME PATH=$PATH
  PYTHONPATH=backend python -m pytest backend/tests/test_<module>.py -q` must
  end with `N passed, 0 failed`.
- **`asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(...)` is forbidden.** Python
  3.12 removed implicit loop creation in non-running contexts and raises
  `RuntimeError`. Use `asyncio.run(coro)` for sync tests calling an async
  function, or `async def` plus the automatic `@pytest.mark.asyncio` (asyncio_mode
  is `auto` in `pytest.ini`) for async tests. The CI gate: `grep -r
  "asyncio.get_event_loop" backend/tests/` must return nothing.
- **Subprocess tests must use `_clean_subprocess_env()` + `_DOTENV_NEUTRALIZE`.**
  Reference pattern in [`backend/tests/test_security_hardening.py`](backend/tests/test_security_hardening.py).
  Inheriting `os.environ` leaks the developer's `.env` (which sets
  `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...@postgres:5432/...`, a hostname only reachable
  inside docker compose) into the subprocess, causing `psycopg2.OperationalError`
  on bare-metal local. The parent pytest process can also leak `.env` vars via
  earlier test imports that trigger `load_dotenv` — `_DOTENV_NEUTRALIZE` plus an
  explicit `env=` whitelist on `subprocess.run` are both needed.
- **Mock at boundaries, not internals.** Wrong: mocking dict operations or
  internal helpers. Right: mocking the HTTP client, the DB session, the Redis
  client, the chain client, the Circle signer. Real precedents to copy:
    - `AgentStateStore` mock for Redis-down scenarios — see
      [`backend/tests/test_api_routes.py`](backend/tests/test_api_routes.py)
      `TestAgentRoutes::test_agent_status_redis_down_defaults` (uses
      `patch.object(AgentStateStore, ..., AsyncMock(side_effect=ConnectionError))`).
    - `chain_client` + `chain_executor` mocking — see
      [`backend/tests/test_api_routes.py`](backend/tests/test_api_routes.py)
      `client` fixture (line 36).
    - SIWE signed-cookie test helper — see
      [`backend/tests/test_user_routes.py`](backend/tests/test_user_routes.py)
      `_siwe_cookies(wallet)` for testing PII-gated endpoints with a real signed
      session (not header spoofing).
    - tmp-sqlite DB fixture — see
      [`backend/tests/test_api_routes.py`](backend/tests/test_api_routes.py)
      `_use_tmp_db` (monkeypatch.setenv DATABASE_URL to a tmp sqlite).
    - `httpx.ASGITransport` for endpoint tests — see
      [`backend/tests/test_risk_routes.py`](backend/tests/test_risk_routes.py).
- **Test the production code path, not the easy one.** When a function accepts
  multiple input types (e.g. `_confirm_receipt` takes both `str` and `bytes`
  HexBytes), the test matrix must cover *every* type the production code path
  emits. The raw-key signer in `chain/executor.py` emits `HexBytes`; tests that
  only exercise the `str` branch leave the production path uncovered. Issue
  [#408](https://github.com/a-apin/archimedes/issues/408) was filed to backfill
  this specific gap.
- **Coverage targets and gates.** Per-module ≥85% line coverage is the standard
  for new test work. Measure with `pytest --cov=archimedes.<module> --cov-report=term-missing
  backend/tests/test_<module>.py`. The repo-level `--cov-fail-under=60` gate
  fires only on `t2o2` agent PRs and is informational for non-Python PRs.
- **No skip-marks on flaky tests.** If a test is flaky, the cause is almost
  always a missing mock at a boundary or hidden environmental state. Fix the
  flakiness, don't `@pytest.mark.skip`. Skip-marks should be rare and load-bearing
  (e.g., "Requires chain_client.settings module-level init mocking" — a known
  architectural limitation, not a flaky test).

### Python linting + formatting (ruff)

Convention: **`line-length = 120`, ruff defaults plus `I,UP,B,SIM,RUF`.** Config
lives at the repo root in [`ruff.toml`](ruff.toml). Two things gate every Python
PR via the `ruff-gate` job:

| Check | Command | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Formatting | `ruff format --check .` | Hard block |
| Critical lint rules | `ruff check --select E9,F63,F7,F40 .` | Hard block |
| Broader lint | `ruff check .` | Informational (continue-on-error) |

The blocking subset is deliberately narrow today (syntax + undefined-module
rules) so the gate doesn't trip on pre-existing style debt. It can grow as we
clean things up — next candidate is `F82` (undefined-name).

**Local feedback loop — install pre-commit once per clone:**
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install                 # installs .git/hooks/pre-commit
pre-commit run --all-files         # one-shot check across the repo
```

The pre-commit hooks ([.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml))
mirror the CI gate exactly, so pre-commit can't pass while CI fails (or vice
versa). They're **opt-in** — devs who don't install them just get the same
feedback from CI on push instead of from `git commit` locally.

**To clean up before committing:**
```bash
ruff check --select I --fix .      # import organization (safe, mechanical)
ruff check --fix .                 # all other safe auto-fixes
ruff format .                      # apply formatting (line-length 120)
```

The `--unsafe-fixes` flag should be reviewed line-by-line — those fixes need
human judgment and are not auto-applied in CI or pre-commit.

### Supply-chain scrutiny — dependency hygiene

We don't bring on new dependencies casually, and we re-check the ones we have. Three
practices:

| Tool | Command | When to run |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pip-audit` | `pip-audit` (whole env) or `pip-audit -r backend/requirements.txt` (declared only) | Before every PR that bumps or adds a Python dep. Once a week as background hygiene. |
| `npm audit` | `cd ui && npm audit --omit=dev` (prod only) or `npm audit` (full) | Before every PR that bumps a Node dep. Dependabot also alerts asynchronously. |
| Dependabot | Auto — see open dependabot PRs in the repo | Always-on. Triage promptly; don't let CVE PRs sit. |

Three rules:

- **Pin transitively-vulnerable deps directly when CVEs warrant it.** Example: `starlette>=1.0.1` is in `environment.yml` + `backend/requirements.txt` to close PYSEC-2026-161 (Host-header bypass) even though it would otherwise come transitively from FastAPI. When `pip-audit` flags a CVE in a transitive dep, add a direct pin to the closest `Fix Versions` so a fresh resolution can't regress.
- **Keep `environment.yml` (local dev) and `backend/requirements.txt` (Docker / CI) aligned.** Drift is the most common source of "works on my machine" + "breaks in CI" — see the `slowapi` and `redis` misalignment that caused 62 user_routes test errors locally on 2026-05-24. Any new pip dep goes in BOTH files in the same PR.
- **No new dep without a sentence on what it does + why we picked it.** Comments in the requirements / env files are how future readers (us in a week) understand the trust surface. "added by tooling" is not a sentence.

**Frontend**: `npm ci` (used by both `quality-gate.yml` lint-report and local `ui/` setup) verifies `package-lock.json` integrity — that's the lockfile hash check we rely on for transitive integrity. Don't `npm install` (which can mutate the lockfile); always `npm ci`.

**Pre-commit + detect-secrets** are tracked as separate hardening (issue TS.7 / #176-adjacent) — not implemented today.

### Smoke-test before deploy

Don't push to shared infrastructure without smoke-testing locally first. If the deploy is a
smart-contract change, run it against an Arc testnet first. The cost of a broken demo
environment is high; the cost of a 5-minute smoke test is low.

### Don't connect important wallets

Standard hackathon hygiene: use a fresh dev wallet for testing, never one with real assets.
Don't paste private keys anywhere in this repo. Use `.env.example` as a template;
`.env` is gitignored.

### Maestro/Worker discipline (lite)

Hosted Claude (Claude Code, claude.ai) is great at architecture, planning, and hard
debugging. Local code completion (Copilot, Cursor) is great at bulk implementation. A few
rules:

- **Use Claude for architecture decisions.** When the choice is between two real options,
  ask Claude for the tradeoff, then make the call as a team. Don't ask Claude to make the
  call.
- **Use Claude to draft specs, then implement against them.** A 1-page spec catches more
  bugs than the implementation does.
- **For PRs and bug fixes, prefer local tooling.** Save Claude budget for the next
  architecture call.
- **Spec drift is real.** If implementation diverges from the spec, update the spec or
  revert the code. Specs are living docs.
- **Multiple team members are using Claude.** Dan and others run concurrent Claude
  sessions (Dan now drives the core build with Claude Code). **Source-of-truth artifacts in `docs/` are how
  we keep parallel sessions aligned** — every session reads from the same docs.

## When to ask before acting (Claude Code session in this repo)

- Pushing to shared infrastructure
- Adding new top-level dependencies (state which package, why, and the license)
- Touching `docker-compose*.yml`, deployment configs, or CI/CD wiring without team alignment
- Any smart contract change (needs **Dan's review as contract owner; Bogdan is the
  preferred second reviewer**) — contracts hold live funds and Dan deploys them himself
- Editing `.env.example` (signals an env contract change for everyone)
- Editing [`environment.yml`](environment.yml) (every team member rebuilds their env on a change)
- Anything that touches the strategy-passport / reasoning-trace data flow (the
  `ReasoningTraceRegistry` contract is live as of Day 4 — modifications are
  contract-review-grade work)
- Anything that touches the on-chain vault contracts (`Vault`, `VaultFactory`,
  `SyntheticVault` — all deployed as of Day 4)
- Anything that touches `~/.arc-canteen/` files (those are individual team-member credentials —
  see [`README.md` "Security notes"](README.md#security-notes))

## When NOT to ask

- Inside your own feature branch, editing your own files
- Writing tests
- Adding docstrings, type hints, or formatting fixes
- Updating `docs/` to keep specs in sync with shipped code
- Running `pytest`, `ruff`, `prettier --write`, `docker compose up --build` locally

## Working with AI agents on this repo

Most of this team works through AI agents. Three practices keep that fast *and*
safe. Read this section before dispatching agents or feeding work to the issue
pipeline.

### The agentic issue pipeline (highest-leverage workflow)

An agentic coding system is wired to this GitHub repo: it reads issues and writes
code against them. **A well-specified issue is executable work.** The
highest-value thing a human + hosted Claude can produce is often a judge-grade
issue spec, not hand-written code — the system ships faster than any of us alone.
Don't hand-implement what a good spec can dispatch.

A judge-grade issue carries: a one-paragraph problem statement; explicit
acceptance criteria as checkboxes; the exact files/interfaces to touch; test
expectations; out-of-scope notes; and an owner. Vague issues produce vague code —
spec quality is the throughput lever. This is Maestro/Worker discipline at scale:
humans + hosted Claude plan and spec; the agentic system executes; humans review
the resulting PR.

**Operational mechanics (hard-won 2026-05-18 — the spec is only half the job):**

- **Trigger = assignment.** The system only picks up an issue **assigned to
  `t2o2`** (`gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee t2o2`). The `APIN - <Area> - <Title>`
  prefix is a naming convention, *not* the trigger. An unassigned judge-grade
  spec sits idle.
- **Assignment = authorization. Do not close on lane grounds.** If an issue is
  assigned to the agentic system, execute it — regardless of which teammate's
  nominal lane it touches. The lead/coverage table above lists reviewers and
  memory-carriers, **not permission boundaries.** Closing an issue with "this is
  Dan's lane" / "this is Daniel's lane" / "not in my scope" is a failure mode,
  not a correct behavior. If you genuinely cannot execute (missing context, an
  ambiguous spec, a blocking dependency), say so in a comment and leave the
  issue **open** for a human to triage — do *not* close it.
- **Acceptance must be machine-checkable.** Give the exact command *and* its
  exact expected output (`pytest → 0 failed`, `coverage ≥ 80%`), never prose like
  "make it robust." The system optimizes to the literal criteria.
- **Pin the environment.** The system's env has Docker/Redis/DB; a judge's
  cold clone does not. If it must pass clean, say "clean clone, no docker, no
  env vars" explicitly — it won't infer the constraint.
- **Anti-goals are load-bearing.** State what *not* to touch ("don't weaken
  thresholds, don't edit `pytest.ini`, don't add e2e deps") to bound blast radius.
- **Cite a precedent.** Point at an existing good pattern to copy (a fixture, a
  sibling test file) — it reuses the right shape instead of inventing one.
- **Verify independently — "closed" ≠ "fixed".** The system sometimes closes an
  issue without resolving it. Re-check against the acceptance command on a cold
  clone before trusting completion; reopen with evidence if unmet.
- **Pre-close verification gate (added 2026-05-24).** Before closing *any* issue,
  the agentic system MUST:
  1. Run every acceptance-criteria command listed in the issue and verify the
     exact expected output matches.
  2. For every anti-goal / "DO NOT" directive (e.g. "DO NOT keep `setMode` in
     `Generate.jsx`"), run an explicit `grep` or equivalent check proving the
     forbidden pattern is absent. If the grep finds a match → the issue is not
     done.
  3. If any acceptance check or anti-goal check fails, do **not** close the
     issue. Instead, comment with the failing evidence and leave the issue
     **open**.
  This gate exists because three issues (#166, #167, #168) were closed with
  commits that touched unrelated files or made cosmetic edits that passed a
  naive heuristic without doing the structural work. Pattern-match on commit
  messages is not verification — running the actual commands is.
- **Verify your own audit claims before acting on them (added 2026-05-27).**
  When an agent (including yourself, earlier in the session) flags a finding
  like "X is in git history" or "Y is a vulnerable dependency," verify it with
  the literal command before recommending or applying the remediation. The
  session example: an audit message flagged `infra/terraform.tfstate` as
  committed-to-git CRITICAL; subsequent verification with `gh api
  search/code -f q="tfstate repo:..."` and `git rev-list --all --objects`
  confirmed it was never tracked — a false alarm. Acting on unverified audit
  claims wastes work and erodes trust in the agent's findings. The rule is
  symmetric: do not over-trust audit output from your past self, and surface
  the verification command alongside any audit claim you make so the next
  reader can re-run it cheaply.

Copy-paste skeleton:

```markdown
## Summary             <!-- one paragraph: the problem, why it matters -->
## Scope               <!-- exact files/interfaces; "do exactly this, nothing more" -->
## Acceptance criteria <!-- checkboxes, each a runnable command + expected output -->
## Verify              <!-- the literal commands a reviewer runs -->
## Anti-goals          <!-- what NOT to do; what NOT to touch -->
<!-- then: gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee t2o2 -->
```

Exemplars: issues #76 and #77 are written to this standard.

### Git safety — every contributor and their agents

Non-negotiable, and load-bearing because the judges read this repo like operators:

- **Never force-push `main`.** Ever. (Force-pushing your own unmerged feature
  branch is fine.)
- Humans: branch + PR → merge to `main`. One logical change per PR; atomic commits.
  The agentic system integrates on `main` directly (build-on-deploy) — that's the
  accepted reality, not a violation; the rule that matters is no force-push + no
  secrets, not "never touch `main`."
- `main` moves continuously — rebase onto it right before merge and merge fast.
- **Never commit secrets or `.env`** — `.env` is gitignored; keep it that way; no
  private keys in the tree. `.gitignore` covers `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`,
  `*.crt`, `*.tfstate*` globally as of 2026-05-27. The
  [`detect-secrets`](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets) pre-commit hook is
  wired in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with the audited baseline at
  `.secrets.baseline` — install with `pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install`
  so commits are scanned locally before push.
- **Rotation alone does not undo a leak.** When a credential is committed and
  later removed, the value remains in `git log -p` forever and on every clone
  anyone has done. Rotation makes the leaked credential *useless going forward*
  (the threat is neutralized) — it does not erase the historical artifact.
  Plan accordingly: don't put a secret in code thinking rotation makes the leak
  fully reversible. The SSH deploy key that lived briefly in
  `infra/archimedes-deploy-key.pem` was rotated 2026-05-26 and the old key
  revoked on the EC2; the leaked bytes are still in git history but useless.
- **Terraform state belongs in S3, never local-committed.** S3 backend: bucket
  versioned + encrypted (SSE-S3) + bucket-policied to deny non-TLS access +
  restrict to the account principal; S3-native locking (`use_lockfile = true`)
  obviates the DynamoDB lock table. See [`infra/README.md`](infra/README.md) for
  bootstrap commands. State can contain real secrets (e.g., the `tls_private_key`
  resource puts a private key into state) — treat the backend as a secrets store
  and scope IAM read access accordingly.
- If an AI agent is uncertain, it **stops and asks** — it does not invent APIs,
  fabricate data, or silently work around a blocker.
- New to the stack: pair on one full branch → push → PR cycle before running
  agents unsupervised. No judgement — the cost of a tangled shared history is
  high; the cost of one paired cycle is low.

### Parallel agent fan-out discipline

Hard-won (2026-05-16); ignore at your peril:

- **Probe with ONE canary agent before any fan-out.** If the canary is blocked at
  a step, the whole fan-out will be too — you pay the fan-out tax for zero
  parallelism.
- **The canary must match the fan-out's execution mode.** A foreground canary
  does *not* validate a background fan-out — they run under different sandboxes.
- **Background subagents are filesystem-sandboxed here** (no writes; cannot exec
  interpreters outside the project dir). Use **foreground** agents for
  implementation fan-out, or a scoped `permissions.allow` in
  `.claude/settings.json`.
- Parallel agents get **isolated git worktrees**, base-SHA-pinned to a recorded
  commit; do not commit to the base branch between dispatches.
- **Clean up worktrees + branches AS YOU GO, not just at session end (added
  2026-06-25).** Parallel worktree-isolated agents accumulate fast — one session
  left **14 stale `.claude/worktrees/agent-*` dirs + ~24 branches**. Discipline:
  (1) when an agent finishes, remove its worktree (`git worktree remove --force
  <path>` — **never a locked / still-running one**) + its local
  `worktree-agent-*` branch, then `git worktree prune`; (2) when a PR merges,
  delete its branch (`gh pr merge --delete-branch`, or `git push origin --delete
  <branch>` + `git branch -D`); (3) keep branches for **open PRs** and
  **in-flight agents**. Turn on the repo's "auto-delete head branches on merge"
  to halve the remote side. Always verify before bulk-deleting: cross-check
  `git worktree list` + `gh pr list --state open` so you never drop a running
  agent's or an open PR's branch.
- **Structure subagent responses to preserve parent context (added 2026-05-27).**
  When dispatching review-style subagents (PR review, audit, multi-file scan),
  specify both a structured response format (`Verdict / What it does / Concerns
  / Recommendation` per item) and a per-item word cap. Three subagents
  reviewing 8 PRs in parallel returned ~3000 words of structured per-PR
  verdicts I could synthesize without re-reading any diff — the structure is
  what made the synthesis cheap. Unstructured "review these PRs and tell me
  what you think" produces long prose that the parent has to re-read and
  re-organize, defeating the context-preservation reason for fan-out.

### Agent-as-proxy authorization (added 2026-05-27)

Teams have lanes (see "Lead + coverage" table) and humans have AI agents that
operate on their behalf. When a teammate is unresponsive for an extended
window (>24h) and work in their lane is blocked, their agent **is authorized
to act as proxy for backend code reviews and merges in that lane**, with two
exceptions:

- **Solidity contract changes still require the human owner's explicit consent.**
  Contracts hold live funds; the owner's contract-specific judgment is
  load-bearing. An agent can review and recommend, but **Dan (the contract owner,
  who deploys them himself) must approve the merge** — and where possible **Bogdan
  (`mnemonik-dev`) provides the two-eyes contract review**. (Updated 2026-06-24:
  contract approval routes to Dan, not Chuan, after the ownership change.)
- **Architecture decisions and infrastructure cost commitments** (new AWS
  services, recurring spend, multi-day migrations) still warrant **Dan's** ack
  (he owns the AWS account). Operational fixes within an already-approved
  architecture are fine to proxy.

This unblocks work without compromising the high-stakes review surfaces.
Document each proxy-merge action in the PR description with a one-line note
("Reviewed by <agent> on Dan's behalf — Dan offline since <timestamp>")
so the human can audit on return. If the human disagrees on return, revert and
re-review — the proxy is a stop-gap, not a delegation.

### Length-limited message surfaces (added 2026-05-27)

When drafting for a hard character limit — Discord (2000 default, 4000 with
Nitro; Dan has Nitro), Twitter/X (280), SMS (160), etc. — **write the final
text to a file and measure it with `wc -m`. Never eyeball.** Two pitfalls
that compounded in this session and produced an over-limit message:

- **`wc -c` counts BYTES, not characters.** UTF-8 multi-byte glyphs inflate
  the byte count without inflating the character count: 🔴 = 4 bytes, em-dash
  — = 3 bytes, arrow → = 3 bytes, all = 1 codepoint each. `wc -m` (and
  Python's `len(str)`) count codepoints, which is what Discord/Twitter/SMS
  count.
- **An estimate is not a measurement.** "Roughly 3,500 chars" stacks an
  arbitrary error on top of any tool error. Run the count on the exact
  final text — not an earlier draft, not an inferred-from-structure
  estimate.

```bash
# Right — measure codepoints on the exact final text:
wc -m < /tmp/discord-msg.md                                  # 3754
python3 -c "print(len(open('/tmp/discord-msg.md').read()))"  # 3754

# Wrong — bytes; undercounts content with emoji/em-dashes:
wc -c < /tmp/discord-msg.md                                  # 3808
```

Aim for ≥5% headroom below the limit so trivial edits don't push you over.
The target surface's own counter is authoritative; `wc -m` agrees with
Discord to within a handful of characters (typically CRLF-vs-LF or
grapheme-cluster edge cases).

When presenting the final text to the user for copy-paste, render it inside
a 4-backtick fence (` ```` `) — not 3-backtick. Inner triple-backticks in
the message (code snippets) will terminate a 3-backtick outer fence and
produce a fragmented copy-block. The 4-backtick outer fence keeps it as one
contiguous copy region.

### Shell quoting in zsh — a recurring agent gotcha (added 2026-06-28)

The interactive shell here is **zsh**, and its quoting/word-splitting rules
differ from bash in ways that have repeatedly bitten agents building commands
on the fly. Two failure modes and their fixes:

- **zsh does NOT word-split unquoted variables.** In bash, `P="--profile X";
  aws s3 ls $P` splits `$P` into two args; in zsh it passes the whole string as
  one arg and the command errors ("Unknown options: --profile X"). **Fix:** never
  stuff multi-token flags into a single var. For AWS, set the environment instead:
  `export AWS_PROFILE=ArchimedesDanAdmin AWS_REGION=us-east-1` and drop the
  per-command `--profile/--region` flags entirely.
- **Inline command-building hits parse errors fast.** Nested `$( … )`, escaped
  `\$(...)`, globs like `--include=*.py` (zsh tries to glob `*.py` → "no matches
  found"), and especially building an `aws ssm send-command --parameters
  'commands=[...]'` payload inline produce `parse error near ')'`-class failures
  that waste turns. **Fix:** for anything non-trivial, write the script to a file
  and feed it in opaquely rather than escaping through the shell:
  ```bash
  # robust: build the remote command + tool input as data, not shell text
  cat > /tmp/remote.sh <<'EOF'      # quoted heredoc → no local expansion
  …multi-line script runs verbatim on the target…
  EOF
  python3 -c "import json,base64;b=base64.b64encode(open('/tmp/remote.sh','rb').read()).decode();\
  json.dump({'InstanceIds':['i-…'],'DocumentName':'AWS-RunShellScript',\
  'Parameters':{'commands':[f'echo {b}|base64 -d|bash']}},open('/tmp/ssm.json','w'))"
  aws ssm send-command --cli-input-json file:///tmp/ssm.json   # no quoting hell
  ```
  Quote globs (`--include='*.py'`) or use `rg`. When a command must interpolate a
  value with special characters, build it in Python (proper escaping) and write a
  `--cli-input-json` / file argument rather than hand-escaping in zsh.

## Architectural primitives we want to get right

These five architectural commitments are load-bearing for the pitch's defensibility.
Detail in [`docs/architectural-principles.md`](docs/architectural-principles.md); principle
here.

> **Academic backstops for the architecture (added Day-12, 2026-05-24):**
> - **Xia et al. 2026 — *Agentic Trading: When LLM Agents Meet Financial Markets*** ([arxiv 2605.19337](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.19337), ESWA). The audit-grade survey of 19 trading-agent papers: **15/19 are R0** (no code/data artifacts), **0/19 reach R3** (fully replayable with artifact versioning + immutable provenance), **2/19** report time-consistent train/test splits, **1/19** has a transaction-cost model, **1/19** documents universe/survivorship handling. Archimedes is engineered to be the first production trading-agent system to ship at R3 and to implement every named protocol Xia formalizes (Outcome Embargo, Time-Aware Retrieval, Hierarchy of Truth, Source Tracking, `V_check`) as **enforced mechanisms** rather than advisory guidelines. Detail in [`docs/specs/xia-2026-protocols.md`](docs/specs/xia-2026-protocols.md).
> - **Chen et al. 2026 — *StockBench*** ([arxiv 2510.02209](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02209)). The first contamination-free, closed-loop, multi-month trading-agent benchmark. Our primary LLM family (GLM-4.5 → GLM-4.7) ranks #3 globally on the model baseline (behind Kimi-K2 and Qwen3-235B-Instruct; ahead of Claude-4-Sonnet at #7 and GPT-5 at #9). **Honest about the agent result:** when we layer Archimedes' Strategy Generation Agent on top, our `T3.8` harness run lands at #15/15 (Sortino -0.91). That underperformance is itself a load-bearing data point — Xia et al. argue (and StockBench corroborates) that *all* LLM agents underperform passive baselines in many windows, and our pitch surfaces this rather than hides it. Detail in [`docs/benchmarks/stockbench-results.md`](docs/benchmarks/stockbench-results.md).

### 1. The strategy passport

Every Tier-1 strategy in the library carries a verifiable record: which paper backs it,
the methodology hash, curator wallet signature, backtest results with paper-claim deltas
surfaced. Detail in [`docs/specs/strategy-passport-spec.md`](docs/specs/strategy-passport-spec.md).

### 2. On-chain provenance anchoring

Reasoning traces, strategy registrations, and rebalance decisions all get hashed and
anchored on Arc via the [`ReasoningTraceRegistry`](contracts/src/ReasoningTraceRegistry.sol)
contract (deployed Day 4; interface at
[`contracts/src/interfaces/IReasoningTraceRegistry.sol`](contracts/src/interfaces/IReasoningTraceRegistry.sol)).
Hash is the integrity primitive; off-chain storage holds the full trace; anyone can
recompute and verify against the on-chain anchor. The Day-3 commit-reveal upgrade
([`docs/specs/commit-reveal-trace-spec.md`](docs/specs/commit-reveal-trace-spec.md))
strengthens "trace existed at T" to "trace existed *before* the trade" with proven
causal ordering — wiring this through the live `ReasoningTraceRegistry` is the v1.5 hop.

### 3. Non-custodial vault architecture

User funds NEVER pass through platform custody. ERC-4626 vault contracts per
[`docs/specs/ecosystem-design-spec.md` § 3.2](docs/specs/ecosystem-design-spec.md) hold
user USDC and synth tokens; the agent has rebalance authority only, not withdraw-to-
platform authority.

### 4. Selection-bias correction (Tier-1 admission gate)

Every Tier-1 strategy passes Deflated Sharpe Ratio (Bailey & López de Prado 2014),
Probability of Backtest Overfitting (Bailey/Borwein/López de Prado/Zhu 2014), walk-
forward out-of-sample Sharpe with no in/out-of-sample cliff, and a look-ahead static
audit before promotion from CANDIDATE → VALIDATED. The numbers and the paper-claim
deltas are surfaced in the passport — never hidden behind an aggregate score. This is
the Day-3 addition that distinguishes Archimedes from the 96 other AI-portfolio
submissions at the last Arc HackMoney. Detail in
[`docs/specs/selection-bias-corrections-spec.md`](docs/specs/selection-bias-corrections-spec.md).

### 5. K=1 generation + externalized rigor gate

Codified 2026-05-23 after a Linus-Maestro architecture audit. The generation
agent emits **one** winner per Generate call (plus a short list of
considered-rejects with the rationale for rejecting each); the rigor gate
runs **externally** to the generator and is what the user reviews on the
strategy passport before deployment. Two reasons this is the right shape:

- **Hosted-LLM budget economics.** K=many generation multiplies LLM cost
  per Generate; K=1 keeps the demo affordable + responsive. The
  considered-rejects panel preserves the "what else was on the table"
  signal without paying for parallel deep generation.
- **Externally-verifiable provenance.** Shifting provenance enforcement
  from runtime types to externally-verifiable hashes (the strategy
  passport's `methodology_hash` + `consulted_paper_hashes` anchored
  on-chain via `ReasoningTraceRegistry`) is a strict upgrade — anyone
  can re-derive and verify; the agent cannot lie about what it consulted.

The user-facing surface this implies: **Generate produces a winner →
the Considered Alternatives panel shows what was rejected and why → the
rigor gate's verdict is rendered on the passport** before the Deploy
button enables. This is the pattern judges should look for when reading
the user journey in [`docs/user-stories.md`](docs/user-stories.md).

Episodic compounding lives on top of this primitive: every fusion
proposal + every rigor verdict + every user-reject is content-hashed
and persisted via the `strategy_proposals` table (T-PE.8 / [issue
#165](https://github.com/a-apin/archimedes-arcadia/issues/165)) so the
library demonstrably *compounds* rather than restarting per session.

### 6. Security and trust ship with the product, not after (added 2026-05-28)

Codified after Dan's stance during the post-hackathon security architecture
work: every person who visits the live site — friends Dan is sharing the URL
with, judges, opportunistic GitHub-clone-derived visitors, eventual real
users — gets the **same** security posture. No "we'll add it when there's
real traffic," no "demo project so we'll cut corners," no waiting for a
revenue milestone before turning on Aurora encryption / WAF / OIDC / SIWE
hardening.

Practical implications for Claude sessions:
- **Don't suggest deferring security work** for cost or scope reasons. If a
  security improvement is the right architecture, recommend it; Dan will
  cover the cost personally if needed (his explicit offer, 2026-05-28).
- **Don't accept "we don't have real users yet" as justification** for not
  shipping a security fix. The bar is "anyone visiting the live site," not
  "anyone who matters commercially."
- When cost-vs-security tension surfaces (e.g., #436's $133→$42/mo
  teardown proposal), surface it but lean toward keeping security live;
  the human will make the call.
- This is a *values* commitment, distinct from the architectural primitives
  above. Those describe what we build; this describes when we ship it.

The corollary for engineering effort: security-relevant PRs (auth, secrets,
permissions, vault contracts, anything PII-adjacent) deserve more careful
review than feature work, even when the diff looks small. The cost of a
miss compounds with every visitor.

## Known risks

Refer to [`docs/design.md` § 10](docs/design.md) for the technical risk matrix and
[`docs/judging-rubric-assessment.md`](docs/judging-rubric-assessment.md) for the running
rubric score. Adding team / coordination risks:

- **Smart-contract + on-chain-integration + infra ownership concentrated in one human
  (updated 2026-06-24).** Chuan formerly owned the contracts, the `backend/archimedes/chain/`
  layer, and infra; with Chuan stepping back, **Dan has taken on all three** (he holds the
  AWS account and deploys the contracts himself). This concentrates the bus factor on Dan,
  who is also evenings/weekends-only — a real constraint. Mitigated by **Bogdan
  (`mnemonik-dev`) as the on-chain/contract reviewer** (he ran the PR #710 audit and owns
  the provenance/IPFS work), Marten as on-chain backup, keeping contracts small with cached
  ABIs, and externalizing contract addresses out of `client.py` (roadmap T2.3). See
  [`docs/architectural-principles.md`](docs/architectural-principles.md) for the general
  pattern.
- **Distributed team across many timezones with day-job constraints.** Mitigated by Marten as
  schedule owner + daily sync + async-first defaults.
- **Traction = 0 on the rubric scoreboard until arc-canteen telemetry starts flowing.**
  Per [`docs/judging-rubric-assessment.md`](docs/judging-rubric-assessment.md), this is
  the cheapest +points to recover. Every meaningful product ship should pair with an
  `arc-canteen update-product` call; every user conversation should be logged via
  `arc-canteen update-traction`.
- **Multiple parallel Claude sessions risk artifact drift.** Mitigated by treating `docs/`
  as single source of truth — and by curating those docs (this file is part of that
  curation rhythm; expect periodic Day-N revisions as reality outpaces specs).
- **Q-fin paper corpus needs Dan's curation.** Dan is evenings/weekends only. v1 ships
  with three paper-grounded strategies seeded (Faber 2007 SMA200, Moreira-Muir 2017
  volatility-managed, Moskowitz-Ooi-Pedersen 2012 TSMOM) plus a buy-and-hold baseline,
  per [`analytics-engine/strategies/`](analytics-engine/strategies/). Corpus expansion
  per [`docs/archive/qfin-paper-corpus-seed.md`](docs/archive/qfin-paper-corpus-seed.md) remains a
  weekend-blocked item.
