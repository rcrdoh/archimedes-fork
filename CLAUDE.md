## Project

**Archimedes** — a fund-of-funds portfolio agent that turns published quant finance research
into investable, backtested strategies, then constructs personalized portfolios of RWA tokens
and yield instruments on Arc with USDC settlement.

> *"Give me a lever long enough and I shall move the world."* The lever here is academic
> research; the fulcrum is autonomous AI; the world is your portfolio.

Built for the [**Agora Agents Hackathon**](https://luma.com/7i50p2r9) — Canteen × Circle × Arc,
May 11–25, 2026.

- Repository: [`github.com/hackagora/archimedes-arcadia`](https://github.com/hackagora/archimedes-arcadia)
- Discord: **Archimedes Arcadia** server
- Branch model: **`main` is the single live branch — build-on-deploy.** Every merge to
  `main` triggers a CI build + deploy to the live EC2 stack. No `develop`/integration
  branch (retired 2026-05-18, unused). Short-lived per-owner branches
  (`dbrowneup/<name>`, `marten`, …) → PR → merge to `main`; `main` moves continuously
  (Chuan's agentic system lands + self-iterates on it), so rebase late and merge fast
- Live testnet deploy: [`http://18.171.230.205/`](http://18.171.230.205/) (EC2,
  Chain ID `5042002` / `0x4cef52`, Arc testnet)

## North Star

A user with idle USDC who wants thoughtful portfolio management — but is tired of black-box
robo-advisors, opaque AI funds, and "trust me bro" influencer copy-trading — connects a
wallet, picks a risk profile, and gets a portfolio constructed from strategies that come
with a **paper-grounded reasoning trace anchored on-chain**. Every position the agent takes,
every rebalance it executes, every regime shift it responds to, is hashed and verifiable.

The Agora narrative frames this:

> *Where AI agents make markets. The agora was where Athens did its thinking out loud.
> Markets are still doing the same job today; they are the social technology by which a
> civilization aggregates knowledge and decides what things are worth. AI agents are the new
> citizens.*

Archimedes is one such citizen — but one whose reasoning trail is open to inspection, whose
claimed alpha is bound to academic research rather than vibes, and whose settlement happens
at sub-second finality on Arc with USDC. The mathematician's name is fitting: he was the
original empiricist working from first principles. We work from peer-reviewed first
principles.

## Team (5 members; ~20-year age span; coverage on every load-bearing skill)

Roughly balanced bios. Ages are author estimates pending team confirmation. Discord handles
in parentheses; the human handles are what shows up in the channel.

| Name                       | Age (est.) | Discord            | Location  | TZ (May)| Role                                                                                                                |

Two team members (Dan, Daniel R) have demanding day roles and commit evenings/weekends.
Chuan runs a real startup but treats the hackathon as serious focus. Marten and Önder are
students with flexible time.

**Daily sync window:** 13:00 UTC = 8am Chicago / 10am São Paulo / 14:00 London / 15:00
Bremen / 16:00 Ankara. Works across the whole team without anyone in unsocial hours.

**Schedule/flow owner:** Marten (showing coordinator instincts since Day 1). Standups in
`#standups` in Discord.

### Non-team contacts

- **Anuhya** (Discord: `moonshot` in the Canteen server, *NOT* the Chuan-moonshot in
  Archimedes Arcadia) is a **Canteen admin** running the hackathon. She is a stakeholder /
  judge-adjacent, not a teammate.

### Role allocation by load-bearing component

| Component                                          | Owner            | Backup                |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Strategy engine + Q-fin paper corpus curation       | Dan              | Önder                 |
| Backtesting / strategy-passport math + risk pricing | Önder            | Dan                   |
| Backend Python layer (FastAPI, API, services, models) | Daniel R.      | Marten                |
| On-chain integration layer (`backend/archimedes/chain/`, oracle runner) | Chuan | Marten          |
| Frontend (React + Vite + viem, wallet UX, trade tab) | Marten (current) / Daniel R. | Dan       |
| Smart contracts (Arc, Foundry, 10 deployed)         | Chuan            | Marten                |
| Infra / EC2 / CI/CD / docker-compose                | Chuan            | Daniel R.             |
| Architecture + design decisions                     | Chuan (lead)     | full team             |
| Pitch deck + demo script + Claude Design + judging  | Dan              | Marten                |

The post-Shimon backend slot resolved as a Daniel R. (Python backend) + Chuan (on-chain
integration) split — the `chain/` subdirectory under `backend/archimedes/` is Chuan's, and
`api/` + `services/` + `models/` + `interfaces/` are Daniel R.'s. Both layers share the
`backend/archimedes/` Python package and the FastAPI app boots them together via
`main.py`. Marten currently has the most recent commits on the React UI as he comes up to
speed on what the team has built.

## Setup

Read [`README.md`](README.md) for the full setup walkthrough — Python conda env via
[`environment.yml`](environment.yml), Node.js frontend, Foundry for contracts, the
[arc-canteen CLI](https://github.com/the-canteen-dev/ARC-cli) for traction tracking,
and a Docker-compose-driven local stack that mirrors the production EC2 deployment.
Platform-specific notes for macOS / Linux / Windows (WSL2 recommended for Marten).

**Spinning up locally is one command** once `.env` is filled in:

```bash
cp .env.example .env       # fill in ANTHROPIC_API_KEY + RPC at minimum
docker compose up -d --build
```

Then <http://localhost> for the UI mockups and <http://localhost:8000/docs> for the
backend API. See README § "Run Archimedes locally" for the full walkthrough.

**Tests:** from the repo root in the `archimedes` conda env, just `pytest` —
`pytest.ini` sets `pythonpath`/`testpaths` and a verbose default (119 tests,
green). Coverage: `pytest --cov=archimedes --cov-report=term-missing`. The
analytics-engine runs its own suite: `cd analytics-engine && uv run pytest`. See
README § "Running the test suite" for the honest coverage picture and the
build-on-deploy integration-test caveat.

## External references — submodules

The repo carries three git submodules at [`submodules/`](submodules/):

- **[`submodules/context-arc/`](submodules/context-arc/)** — Circle's agent-facing
  developer docs and 5 reference codebases for Arc + Circle. **This is the canonical
  reference for any Arc/Circle integration question.** Start with
  [`submodules/context-arc/AGENTS.md`](submodules/context-arc/AGENTS.md) for the
  task-indexed entry-point table. Highest-leverage files for our build:
    - `circlefin-skills/use-smart-contract-platform.md` — contract deploy + monitor (Chuan's lane)
    - `circlefin-skills/bridge-stablecoin.md` — CCTP + Gateway for RWA bridging (Marten's lane)
    - `circlefin-skills/use-gateway.md` — unified balance + nanopayments
    - `samples/arc-escrow/` — closest existing pattern to our vault contract
    - `samples/arc-multichain-wallet/` — CCTP integration patterns
    - `samples/arc-p2p-payments/` — Paymaster + USDC patterns
  Refresh upstream with `git submodule update --remote submodules/context-arc` or
  `arc-canteen context sync` (drops into `~/.arc-canteen/context/`).
- **[`submodules/KnowledgeBase/`](submodules/KnowledgeBase/)** — Dan's scientific-
  paper analysis pipeline (PyMuPDF extract + SPECTER2 embeddings + HDBSCAN/BERTopic
  clustering + REBEL/SciSpacy knowledge graph). For Archimedes, **don't port wholesale**
  — read it as a reference implementation. The patterns worth lifting for the
  Tier-1 arxiv extraction pipeline:
    - `papers_analysis/extract.py` — PyMuPDF caching pattern (~71 files/s)
    - `papers_analysis/metadata.py` — paper-corpus schema (maps to our `paper_corpus` table)
    - `papers_analysis/summarize.py` — Ollama-driven methodology synthesis (we'd use Claude)
- **[`submodules/Linus/`](submodules/Linus/)** — Dan's personal AI orchestration
  project. Reference only; nothing to port to Archimedes. The
  [`experiments/archimedes/`](submodules/Linus/experiments/archimedes/) and
  [`experiments/agora-hackathon/`](submodules/Linus/experiments/agora-hackathon/)
  directories contain the priors that seeded several of our current `docs/` files.

## arc-canteen CLI — telemetry surface for the 30% Traction weight

Every teammate authenticates individually (`arc-canteen login` → GitHub device flow).
The CLI is two things in one binary:

1. A **per-developer Arc-testnet RPC proxy.** `arc-canteen rpc <method>` proxies JSON-RPC
   calls through Canteen's server. The per-user `swrm_*` token in `~/.arc-canteen/env`
   authenticates. Allowlist: most reads + `eth_sendRawTransaction`. **The full RPC URL
   is a secret — see README § "Understanding the RPC URL" for the threat model.**
2. The **traction telemetry surface that the rubric reads.** Every meaningful product
   ship should be paired with an `arc-canteen update-product` call; every user we
   onboard or even talk to should be logged via `arc-canteen update-traction`. The
   30% Traction score is computed from this telemetry, not from anywhere else. **Until
   we start logging, the rubric reads zero.** See
   [`docs/judging-rubric-assessment.md`](docs/judging-rubric-assessment.md) for where we
   currently stand.

`arc-canteen status` shows your current dashboard — what the judges see.

## Tech Stack

Refer to [`docs/design.md` § 6](docs/design.md) for the full table. Headline choices as
they actually shipped (Day 4):

- **Backend:** Python 3.12 / FastAPI / Uvicorn, packaged as `backend/archimedes/` with
  subpackages `api/` (routes), `chain/` (on-chain integration + oracle runner),
  `interfaces/` (frozen Protocol classes), `models/` (Strategy, BacktestResult,
  ReasoningTrace, Portfolio dataclasses), `services/` (LocalStrategyProvider etc.)
- **Frontend:** React 19 + Vite 8 + viem 2.48 + plain CSS. Lives at [`ui/`](ui/) (the
  earlier `ui-mockups/` static-HTML directory is now retired but still in-tree).
  Components shipped: `Layout`, `WalletConnect` (MetaMask / Coinbase / generic browser
  wallet), `Trade`
- **Analytics engine:** [`analytics-engine/`](analytics-engine/) — uv-managed Python
  package with the backtrader runner. Loads strategy files from
  [`analytics-engine/strategies/`](analytics-engine/strategies/)
- **DB:** PostgreSQL + Redis (Postgres for strategies + backtests; Redis for live regime
  state)
- **LLM:** Claude API for strategy extraction, reasoning trace generation, user-facing
  explanations
- **Backtesting:** [backtrader](https://github.com/mementum/backtrader) for v1 per
  [`docs/specs/backtrader-vs-vectorbt-decision-memo.md`](docs/specs/backtrader-vs-vectorbt-decision-memo.md).
  Supersedes `docs/design.md` § 6 ("vectorbt / custom numpy engine") on this one
  line; design.md remains the architecture spec for everything else. Migration to
  vectorbt is a v2 problem if parameter-sweep speed becomes a constraint.
- **Smart contracts:** Solidity + Foundry, targeting Arc (EVM-compatible). **10 contracts
  deployed on Arc testnet as of Day 4**: `AMMPool`, `AMMRouter`, `AssetRegistry`,
  `PriceOracle`, `ReasoningTraceRegistry`, `SyntheticFactory`, `SyntheticToken`,
  `SyntheticVault`, `Vault`, `VaultFactory`. ABIs cached in
  [`contracts/abis/`](contracts/abis/) for backend + UI consumption
- **On-chain integration:** Circle SDK — Wallets (Circle-managed wallet for the oracle
  signer), USYC, Gateway, CCTP, Paymaster; viem on the UI side
- **Deployment:** Docker compose stack (5 services: postgres / redis / nginx / oracle /
  backend) running on an EC2 instance behind nginx. CI/CD wired via GitHub Actions per
  [`docs/infra-setup.md`](docs/infra-setup.md). Live at
  [`http://18.171.230.205/`](http://18.171.230.205/)

## Scope — the headline commitments

Refer to [`docs/mvp-scope-memo.md`](docs/mvp-scope-memo.md) for the full argument. Locked
decisions (5 of them as of Day 3):

1. **Primary RFB:** [RFB 04 — Adaptive Portfolio Manager](https://luma.com/7i50p2r9).
   Adjacent: RFB 02 (Kelly/+EV math primitive); RFB 06 (strategy leaderboard).
2. **Both on-chain stories:** vault contracts for portfolio allocation **and** the
   ReasoningTraceRegistry for verifiable provenance. Both shipping.
3. **Curated v1 strategy library:** 5–10 hand-curated quant strategies; arxiv ingest
   pipeline runs as a demo feature on 2–3 papers, not relied on for live decisions.
4. **(Day 3) Rigor is the wedge.** Every Tier-1 strategy passes the four selection-bias
   controls (DSR + PBO + walk-forward OOS + look-ahead audit) before admission to the
   library. Paper-claim deltas are surfaced honestly, not hidden behind an aggregate
   score. See [`docs/specs/selection-bias-corrections-spec.md`](docs/specs/selection-bias-corrections-spec.md).
5. **(Day 3) Two-tier marketplace.** Tier 1 (Archimedes Verified 🏆) = paper-grounded +
   selection-bias-corrected + full agent autonomy. Tier 2 (Community 👥) = permissionless,
   opt-in agent features. Per [`docs/specs/ecosystem-design-spec.md`](docs/specs/ecosystem-design-spec.md).
- **Demo vertical:** portfolio construction + autonomous rebalancing on Arc, NOT trading-
  agent-as-product. Per [`docs/architectural-principles.md`](docs/architectural-principles.md),
  the wedge is verifiable history + paper-grounded provenance + selection-bias rigor.
- **Out of scope:** see [`docs/anti-features.md`](docs/anti-features.md), including the
  Day-3 "pitch-rigor anti-claims" section that constrains the deck framing.

## Engineering conventions

### Branch model (build-on-deploy, main-only)

Codified 2026-05-18 to match how the team actually works (see
"Working with AI agents on this repo" below):

- **`main` is the only long-lived branch, and it is the deploy branch.** Every merge
  to `main` triggers a CI build + deploy to the live EC2 stack. There is no
  `develop`/integration branch — it drifted unused and was retired.
- **`main` moves continuously.** Chuan's agentic system merges work and iterates on
  its own CI failures directly on `main`. Treat `main` as fast-moving: branch from it
  late, rebase onto it right before merging, and merge in a tight window before it
  drifts again. Don't wait for it to "settle" — it won't.
- Short-lived per-owner branches `<discord-handle>/<short-name>` → PR → merge to
  `main`. Delete the branch after merge.
- **The few hard rules — universal, and they do not impede speed:** never force-push
  `main`; never commit secrets or `.env`; one logical change per PR. Force-pushing
  your *own* unmerged feature branch is fine and expected (rebase-before-merge).
- On-chain / smart-contract changes still warrant Chuan's eyes given live-funds risk.

### PR reviews

For a 5-person hackathon team operating async across 5 timezones, **one approving review**
is enough for non-contract changes. Contract changes get two. Reviewers should respond
within ~12 hours during the hackathon so the contributor isn't blocked overnight.

### Commit style

Imperative mood ("Add strategy passport schema" not "Added strategy passport schema").
Scope tags optional but encouraged: `[strategy]`, `[backtest]`, `[contracts]`, `[frontend]`,
`[infra]`, `[docs]`. Atomic commits — one logical change per commit; don't bundle.

### Smoke-test before deploy

Don't push to shared infrastructure without smoke-testing locally first. If the deploy is a
smart-contract change, run it against an Arc testnet first. The cost of a broken demo
environment is high; the cost of a 5-minute smoke test is low.

### Don't connect important wallets

Standard hackathon hygiene: use a fresh dev wallet for testing, never one with real assets.
Don't paste private keys anywhere in this repo. Use `.env.example` as a template;
`.env` is gitignored.

### Maestro/Worker discipline (lite)

Hosted Claude (Claude Code, claude.ai) is great at architecture, planning, and hard
debugging. Local code completion (Copilot, Cursor) is great at bulk implementation. A few
rules:

- **Use Claude for architecture decisions.** When the choice is between two real options,
  ask Claude for the tradeoff, then make the call as a team. Don't ask Claude to make the
  call.
- **Use Claude to draft specs, then implement against them.** A 1-page spec catches more
  bugs than the implementation does.
- **For PRs and bug fixes, prefer local tooling.** Save Claude budget for the next
  architecture call.
- **Spec drift is real.** If implementation diverges from the spec, update the spec or
  revert the code. Specs are living docs.
- **Multiple team members are using Claude.** Chuan (20× Max), Dan (5× Max), and others
  are running concurrent Claude sessions. **Source-of-truth artifacts in `docs/` are how
  we keep parallel sessions aligned** — every session reads from the same docs.

## When to ask before acting (Claude Code session in this repo)

- Pushing to shared infrastructure
- Adding new top-level dependencies (state which package, why, and the license)
- Touching `docker-compose*.yml`, deployment configs, or CI/CD wiring without team alignment
- Any smart contract change (needs Chuan's review)
- Editing `.env.example` (signals an env contract change for everyone)
- Editing [`environment.yml`](environment.yml) (every team member rebuilds their env on a change)
- Anything that touches the strategy-passport / reasoning-trace data flow (the
  `ReasoningTraceRegistry` contract is live as of Day 4 — modifications are
  contract-review-grade work)
- Anything that touches the on-chain vault contracts (`Vault`, `VaultFactory`,
  `SyntheticVault` — all deployed as of Day 4)
- Anything that touches `~/.arc-canteen/` files (those are individual team-member credentials —
  see [`README.md` "Security notes"](README.md#security-notes))

## When NOT to ask

- Inside your own feature branch, editing your own files
- Writing tests
- Adding docstrings, type hints, or formatting fixes
- Updating `docs/` to keep specs in sync with shipped code
- Running `pytest`, `ruff`, `prettier --write`, `docker compose up --build` locally

## Working with AI agents on this repo

Most of this team works through AI agents. Three practices keep that fast *and*
safe. Read this section before dispatching agents or feeding work to the issue
pipeline.

### The agentic issue pipeline (highest-leverage workflow)

An agentic coding system is wired to this GitHub repo: it reads issues and writes
code against them. **A well-specified issue is executable work.** The
highest-value thing a human + hosted Claude can produce is often a judge-grade
issue spec, not hand-written code — the system ships faster than any of us alone.
Don't hand-implement what a good spec can dispatch.

A judge-grade issue carries: a one-paragraph problem statement; explicit
acceptance criteria as checkboxes; the exact files/interfaces to touch; test
expectations; out-of-scope notes; and an owner. Vague issues produce vague code —
spec quality is the throughput lever. This is Maestro/Worker discipline at scale:
humans + hosted Claude plan and spec; the agentic system executes; humans review
the resulting PR.

### Git safety — every contributor and their agents

Non-negotiable, and load-bearing because the judges read this repo like operators:

- **Never force-push `main`.** Ever. (Force-pushing your own unmerged feature
  branch is fine.)
- Humans: branch + PR → merge to `main`. One logical change per PR; atomic commits.
  The agentic system integrates on `main` directly (build-on-deploy) — that's the
  accepted reality, not a violation; the rule that matters is no force-push + no
  secrets, not "never touch `main`."
- `main` moves continuously — rebase onto it right before merge and merge fast.
- **Never commit secrets or `.env`** — `.env` is gitignored; keep it that way; no
  private keys in the tree.
- If an AI agent is uncertain, it **stops and asks** — it does not invent APIs,
  fabricate data, or silently work around a blocker.
- New to the stack: pair on one full branch → push → PR cycle before running
  agents unsupervised. No judgement — the cost of a tangled shared history is
  high; the cost of one paired cycle is low.

### Parallel agent fan-out discipline

Hard-won (2026-05-16); ignore at your peril:

- **Probe with ONE canary agent before any fan-out.** If the canary is blocked at
  a step, the whole fan-out will be too — you pay the fan-out tax for zero
  parallelism.
- **The canary must match the fan-out's execution mode.** A foreground canary
  does *not* validate a background fan-out — they run under different sandboxes.
- **Background subagents are filesystem-sandboxed here** (no writes; cannot exec
  interpreters outside the project dir). Use **foreground** agents for
  implementation fan-out, or a scoped `permissions.allow` in
  `.claude/settings.json`.
- Parallel agents get **isolated git worktrees**, base-SHA-pinned to a recorded
  commit; do not commit to the base branch between dispatches.
- Dismantle worktrees at end of session; retain their branches until the PRs
  merge.

## Architectural primitives we want to get right

These four architectural commitments are load-bearing for the pitch's defensibility.
Detail in [`docs/architectural-principles.md`](docs/architectural-principles.md); principle
here.

### 1. The strategy passport

Every Tier-1 strategy in the library carries a verifiable record: which paper backs it,
the methodology hash, curator wallet signature, backtest results with paper-claim deltas
surfaced. Detail in [`docs/specs/strategy-passport-spec.md`](docs/specs/strategy-passport-spec.md).

### 2. On-chain provenance anchoring

Reasoning traces, strategy registrations, and rebalance decisions all get hashed and
anchored on Arc via the [`ReasoningTraceRegistry`](contracts/src/ReasoningTraceRegistry.sol)
contract (deployed Day 4; interface at
[`contracts/src/interfaces/IReasoningTraceRegistry.sol`](contracts/src/interfaces/IReasoningTraceRegistry.sol)).
Hash is the integrity primitive; off-chain storage holds the full trace; anyone can
recompute and verify against the on-chain anchor. The Day-3 commit-reveal upgrade
([`docs/specs/commit-reveal-trace-spec.md`](docs/specs/commit-reveal-trace-spec.md))
strengthens "trace existed at T" to "trace existed *before* the trade" with proven
causal ordering — wiring this through the live `ReasoningTraceRegistry` is the v1.5 hop.

### 3. Non-custodial vault architecture

User funds NEVER pass through platform custody. ERC-4626 vault contracts per
[`docs/specs/ecosystem-design-spec.md` § 3.2](docs/specs/ecosystem-design-spec.md) hold
user USDC and synth tokens; the agent has rebalance authority only, not withdraw-to-
platform authority.

### 4. Selection-bias correction (Tier-1 admission gate)

Every Tier-1 strategy passes Deflated Sharpe Ratio (Bailey & López de Prado 2014),
Probability of Backtest Overfitting (Bailey/Borwein/López de Prado/Zhu 2014), walk-
forward out-of-sample Sharpe with no in/out-of-sample cliff, and a look-ahead static
audit before promotion from CANDIDATE → VALIDATED. The numbers and the paper-claim
deltas are surfaced in the passport — never hidden behind an aggregate score. This is
the Day-3 addition that distinguishes Archimedes from the 96 other AI-portfolio
submissions at the last Arc HackMoney. Detail in
[`docs/specs/selection-bias-corrections-spec.md`](docs/specs/selection-bias-corrections-spec.md).

## Known risks

Refer to [`docs/design.md` § 10](docs/design.md) for the technical risk matrix and
[`docs/judging-rubric-assessment.md`](docs/judging-rubric-assessment.md) for the running
rubric score. Adding team / coordination risks:

- **Chuan as smart-contract + on-chain-integration bus factor 1.** Day-4 reality: Chuan
  owns the contracts AND the `backend/archimedes/chain/` layer AND infra. Mitigated by
  Marten as documented backup and by keeping contracts small with cached ABIs. See
  [`docs/architectural-principles.md`](docs/architectural-principles.md) for the general
  pattern.
- **5-person team across 5 timezones with 3 day-job constraints.** Mitigated by Marten as
  schedule owner + daily sync + async-first defaults.
- **Traction = 0 on the rubric scoreboard until arc-canteen telemetry starts flowing.**
  Per [`docs/judging-rubric-assessment.md`](docs/judging-rubric-assessment.md), this is
  the cheapest +points to recover. Every meaningful product ship should pair with an
  `arc-canteen update-product` call; every user conversation should be logged via
  `arc-canteen update-traction`.
- **Multiple parallel Claude sessions risk artifact drift.** Mitigated by treating `docs/`
  as single source of truth — and by curating those docs (this file is part of that
  curation rhythm; expect periodic Day-N revisions as reality outpaces specs).
- **Q-fin paper corpus needs Dan's curation.** Dan is evenings/weekends only. v1 ships
  with three paper-grounded strategies seeded (Faber 2007 SMA200, Moreira-Muir 2017
  volatility-managed, Moskowitz-Ooi-Pedersen 2012 TSMOM) plus a buy-and-hold baseline,
  per [`analytics-engine/strategies/`](analytics-engine/strategies/). Corpus expansion
  per [`docs/qfin-paper-corpus-seed.md`](docs/qfin-paper-corpus-seed.md) remains a
  weekend-blocked item.
